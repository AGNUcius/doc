The GNUrho is an insuring deposit currency with a face value of a quantity and quality of good or service within some time-frame.

GNUrho are "issued against" or "backed by" the combined value of:

1. The Physical Sources of production needed to provide the good or service under the jurisdiction of the GNU's Not Usury General Public Law.  This is a "Title of Ownership" over Physical Sources [Material Means of Production] needed to accomplish some production.  This Property Deed is issued by legal owners and received by the person or group paying price above cost during any act of trade falling under the jurisdiction of the GNU General Public Law.

2. Promisory notes for the human labor needed to install, operate, maintain, secure and insure those Physical Sources.  This is a "Promise to Pay" some quantity and quality of good or service during some window of time.  This contract against future labor may be issued by an individual worker, by a group of workers or by an accreditation - entity.


==EXAMPLES of 'Face Value'
1 gallon of raw milk per week
1 lb Grade AA raw butter per week
1 Doz Grade A eggs per week
1 oil-change and chassis lube per year.
1 game of bowling per month
1 mile of bus service per day
1 mile of taxi service per day


==EXAMPLES of 'Backing Value'
====Examples of Physical Source Title:
 "Dairy cattle + land, water, feed, machines, buildings, tools needed to host those cattle."
 "Chickens + land, water, feed, machines, buildings, tools for hosting."
 "Motor oil and grease + land, machines, buildings, tools for hosting."
 "Bowling alley + land, machines, buildings, tools for hosting."
 "Bus + land, machines, buildings, tools for hosting."
 "Taxi + land, machines, buildings, tools for hosting."

====Examples of Physical Work Bond:
 "Will milk cows at the X dairy every day until the end of this year."
 "Will make butter at the X dairy every other day until July 1st 3033."
 "Will feed chickens and gather eggs at the X chicken farm every day until the end of February."
 "Will change oil and lube chassis at the X automotive garage every Tuesday and Thursday until December 21 of this year."
 "Will maintain the X bowling alley every Saturday and Sunday until I get sick of it; will give 1 week notice."
 "Will drive X bus every Monday and Wednesday from 8am to 2pm for a while...  I will give 2 weeks notice before leaving."
 "Will drive X taxi from 6pm to 1am every Friday and Saturday until I get bored of it.  May not warn before I quit."


Each individual worker sets his own conditions for fulfilling a Work Bonds.

Co-owners should advertise minimum allowable standards to avoid attracting workers unwilling to meet those constraints.

Each GNUrho represents all *potential* production of those Physical assets, and so is much more powerful/valuable than a typical currency.

It might be useful to also issue 'tickets' against future payouts that would more closely resemble typical currency.

Each ticket would have a window of validity - where it could not be used before some certain time, nor could it be used after some other certain time.

For example, a group might issue a book of 52 tickets each year for products that are used weekly.

Ideally this will all be electronic and we will simply carry a card or identify ourselves in some other manner to collect the goods and services we already own, and to track that use to disallow cheating.  (We must defend ourselves against someone who pays for 1 gallon of milk per week, but then tries to collect more).


Each GNUrho should represent the societal need as assessed by object users according to the full price paid - where paying up to cost indicates worth, and paying any amount over cost as a desire to grow.

Free Hardware owners issue GNUrho to new object users in response to that consumer paying a price above the total costs (including wages) expended in the creation of that object instance.


Owners who share Free Objects will issue new GNUrho titles to any user who pays more than cost.  The amount traditionally calculated as profit is offered back to the user as shares of ownership in the perpetuation of the Free Sources(TM) required to produce more Objects of this same variety.

Object users are new investors in the physical Sources needed for future production in exactly the amount they pay above cost.  This distributes control as shares of divisible ownership in the physical sources of production so objects become free for each user.

This distributes control so the objects of physical sources stay free.  Object users become investors in the Sources needed for future production in proportion to the the amount they pay above cost, as this is a measurement of the need to grow.

Owners have real costs associated with physical sources.
Costs differ by management and current level of development.
Users pay owners to buy or hire what they want.
Workers pay owners to buy or hire capital want.
Profit is the difference between Consumer Price and Owner Cost.



==End User Object DEED
As a free object user you MAY:
  0. Use this instance for any purpose.
  1. Modify this instance by renting or buying the physical sources needed for that modification.  (YOU ARE ALREADY A CO-OWNER IF YOU PAID PRICE ABOVE COST.)
  2. Copy this instance by renting or buying the physical sources needed for that production.  (YOU ARE ALREADY A CO-OWNER IF YOU PAID PRICE ABOVE COST.)
  3. Share this instance or a copy - whether modified or not.

	If you share this object instance or a copy - whether modified or not, you MUST:
	  A. Accompany each instance with a copy of this DEED.
	  B. Treat all profit gained through the sale of this object or through the rental of physical sources as an investment from that user toward more physical sources.
	  C. Issue GNUrho currency against those physical sources.

[*Profit separates from wage as property is multiplexed (during co-ownership).]



On the one hand I think owners who
intend to keep the Sources for the
Product will naturally take care of
that property and trade the Skills
needed to achieve that production.

On the other hand, the owner might
want to pretend the Token is valid
once he decides to use it in trade.

I'm not sure what we can do other
than maybe require a 'notice' on
Tokens using our social contract.

The notice would explain the Product
is an expected but not guaranteed
quantity and quality.

The social contract itself would
contain instructions about how this
notice must be legible and even a
prominent part of the coin or card.
