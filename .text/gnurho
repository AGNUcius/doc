The GNUrho is an insuring deposit currency with a face value of some good or service within some time-frame.

GNUrho are "issued against" or "backed by" the combined value of:

1. The Physical Sources of production needed to provide the good or service under the jurisdiction of the GNU's Not Usury General Public Law.  This is a "Title of Ownership" over Physical Sources [Material Means of Production] needed to accomplish some production.  This Property Deed is issued by legal owners and received by the person or group paying price above cost during any act of trade falling under the jurisdiction of the GNU General Public Law.

2. Promisory notes for the human labor needed to install, operate, maintain, secure and insure those Physical Sources.  This is a "Promise to Pay" some quantity and quality of good or service during some window of time.  This contract against future labor may be issued by an individual worker, by a group of workers or by an accreditation - entity.


==EXAMPLES of 'Face Value'
1 gallon of whole, raw milk per week for 52 weeks.
1 lb Grade AA salted butter per week for 52 weeks.
1 Doz Grade A eggs per week for 52 weeks.
1 oil-change and chassis lube per year.
1 game of bowling.
1 hr of bus fare.
1 mile of taxi service.


==EXAMPLES of 'Backing Value'
====Examples of Physical Source Title:
 "Dairy cattle + land, water, feed, machines, buildings, tools needed to host those cattle."
 "Chickens + land, water, feed, machines, buildings, tools for hosting."
 "Motor oil and grease + land, machines, buildings, tools for hosting."
 "Bowling alley + land, machines, buildings, tools for hosting."
 "Bus + land, machines, buildings, tools for hosting."
 "Taxi + land, machines, buildings, tools for hosting."

====Examples of Physical Work Bond:
 "Will operate dairy every day for 365 days."
 "Will operate chicken farm every day for 365 days."
 "Will operate automotive garage for one oil-change and chassis lube."
 "Will operate bowling alley for one game of bowling."
 "Will operate bus for one hour."
 "Will operate taxi for one mile."


Most GNUrho will be 'recurring' since the "Physical Source Title" part of them represent ownership in the Physical Sources of that production.

But it might be best to issue them as separable 'tickets' ~ so the butter, eggs or milk might be issued as a book of 52 tickets...

Ideally this will all be electronic and we will simply carry a card or identify ourselves in some other manner to collect the goods we already own.

Electronic ownership titles will be almost neccessary to automate the exchange between each GNUrho type.

Each GNUrho should represent the societal need as assessed by object users according to the full price paid - where paying up to cost indicates worth, and paying any amount over cost as a desire to grow.

Free Hardware owners issue GNUrho to new object users in response to that consumer paying a price above the total costs (including wages) expended in the creation of that object instance.


Owners who share Free Objects must issue new GNUrho titles to any user who pays more than cost.  The amount traditionally calculated as profit is offered back to the user as shares of ownership in the perpetuation of the Free Sources(TM) required to produce more Objects of this same variety.

Object users are new investors in the physical Sources needed for future production in exactly the amount they pay above cost.  This distributes control as shares of divisible ownership in the physical sources of production so objects become free for each user.

This distributes control so the objects of physical sources stay free.  Object users become investors in the Sources needed for future production in proportion to the the amount they pay above cost, as this is a measurement of the need to grow.

Owners have real costs associated with physical sources.
Costs differ by management and current level of development.
Users pay owners to buy or hire what they want.
Workers pay owners to buy or hire capital want.
Profit is the difference between Consumer Price and Owner Cost.



==End User Object DEED
As a free object user you MAY:
  0. Use this instance for any purpose.
  1. Modify this instance by renting or buying the physical sources needed for that modification.  (YOU ARE ALREADY A CO-OWNER IF YOU PAID PRICE ABOVE COST.)
  2. Copy this instance by renting or buying the physical sources needed for that production.  (YOU ARE ALREADY A CO-OWNER IF YOU PAID PRICE ABOVE COST.)
  3. Share this instance or a copy - whether modified or not.

	If you share this object instance or a copy - whether modified or not, you MUST:
	  A. Accompany each instance with a copy of this DEED.
	  B. Treat all profit gained through the sale of this object or through the rental of physical sources as an investment from that user toward more physical sources.
	  C. Issue GNUrho currency against those physical sources.

[*Profit separates from wage as property is multiplexed (during co-ownership).]

I understand what you mean.

On the one hand I think owners who
intend to keep the SOURCES for the
PRODUCT will naturally take care of
that property and trade the SKILLS
needed to achieve that production.

On the other hand, the owner might
want to pretend the Token is valid
once he decides to use it in trade.

I'm not sure what we can do other
than maybe require a 'notice' on
Tokens using our social contract.

The notice would explain the PRODUCT
is an expected but not guaranteed
quantity and quality.

The social contract itself would
contain instructions about how this
notice must be legible and even a
prominent part of the coin or card.
