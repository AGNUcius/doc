VirtualGL.org >>VirtualGL is an open source package which provides hardware-accelerated 3D rendering capabilities to thin clients.  Normally, when you run a 3D application inside a thin client environment (e.g. VNC, remote X11, NX, etc.), the 3D application either does not work at all, is forced to use a slow software 3D renderer, or (worse) is forced to send every 3D command and piece of 3D data over the network to be rendered on the client machine.  With VirtualGL, the 3D rendering commands from the application are intercepted at run time and redirected onto the server's 3D accelerator hardware.  The resulting rendered images are then read back from the 3D hardware and composited into the appropriate window on the user's desktop.  This produces a completely seamless shared 3D environment that performs fast enough to take the place of a dedicated 3D workstation.
