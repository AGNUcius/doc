May-28-2012: Imputation as a comprehensive strategy

May-20-2012: 
Yes, in fact the customers pay *all* the costs of production, and yet have no control of how those products are made because they lack the co-ownership that would give them real voting power.

Imagine groups of customers organize to purchase and co-own the factories and farms for which they need the outputs.

Each person would invest just enough (either Capital or Labor) to cover the predicted costs of production for the amount of Product they each intend to use.

Each of these [investor/owner/customer/worker]s would still need to pay their % of the costs as usual, but since they would accept the Product itself as the return for that risk, there would be sale, and so Profit would not exist at all.

May-19-2012: Crowd-Owned Social Enterprise

1.) Product is the Investor's Return.  This means Consumers will micro-invest by pre-paying for results, become co-owners of that business and receive the Product itself as a side-effect of that ownership.

2.) Profit is the Payer's Investment.  This means late-coming Consumers will overpay for Product as usual, but we will treat (at least some % of) that value as though they had invested as described in #1.

3.) Investments are commitments of Future Labor and Physical Sources.  This means we will issue a deposit-based, *insuring* currency backed by both the land and tools and other inputs, plus the work needed to transform those assets into a Product.


These adjustments allow us to move away from excessive token-passing and toward productivity that can safely reach stasis - eliminating the perceived need for infinite growth.

Sincerely,
