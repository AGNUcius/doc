OWNers Rule.

That would be fine if property were only either of single-owner 'Personal' or truly cooperative when jointly owned as 'Public'.

But most production occurs on 'Proprietary' property that perpetuates profit through the privatization of our planet's plenty by hoarding finite resources such as land, water, oil, genetics, intellect, design, software, etc. making it more expensive and dangerous for those who do not already own.

And the false 'Public' property sometimes call "Representative Government" we currently face is managed by employees we 'elect' from a small, secretly pre-chosen pool of wealthy and/or corporate funded con artists.  These unhired 'representatives' are somehow out of the citizen's divisible control.  The people who should be understood to be OUR employees as managers of our Physical Sources are instead puppeteered by proprietary property owners through the legal routes of lobbying and 'contributions'.

We need a better way to hold joint property in a cooperative 'Public' manner.  We need Public Utilities that *really* serve the consuming citizens who pay for them, and do so while causing price to approach cost.
