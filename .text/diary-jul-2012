I work best with very negative feedback, since I
otherwise have no way to know something is wrong.

I think the rule should be "If you can't say something
critical, you may as well say nothing at all."

But most people do not work like that; they actually
*want* you to lie to them so they "feel better".

The want you to tell them they are X when they already
know they are *not* X.

They are offended when they are told the truth, and
direct their anger to the messenger even when they
know the message is true.


I study as many systems as I can find, and always
compare them against my approach, but my findings are
usually ignored and people tend to dislike me as a
person because they think I am trying to be needlessly
'negative' or 'caustic'.

I'm just trying to 'debug' the system so we can organize in a more effective way, 

Over and over I am told to "If you thingk it is such a
great idea, stop talking about it and just go *DO* it!".

Receive Means or "Promise to Work" when you invest.
Investments are: Means, "Promise to Work" or Profit.

Demand increases Profit.
Profit increases Supply.

Retain Property when you pay recurring Costs.
Retain Property when you Secede for any reason.

You own the Product when you own the Means.

Property + "Promise to work" = Real Insurance.

Time Bank
Vertical Integration
Horizontal Diversity
