http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm >>Nomic  A Game of Self-Amendment Peter Suber, Philosophy Department, Earlham College    Nomic is a game I invented in 1982.  It's a game in which changing the rules is a move.  The Initial Set of rules does little more than regulate the rule-changing process.  While most of its initial rules are procedural in this sense, it does have one substantive rule (on how to earn points toward winning); but this rule is deliberately boring so that players will quickly amend it to please themselves.  The Initial Set of rules, some commentary by me, and some reflections by Douglas Hofstadter, were published in Hofstadter's "Metamagical Themas" column in Scientific American in June of 1982.  It was quickly translated into many European and Asian languages.  Games were regularly played, and kicked off, the ARPANET, the Defense Department network which sired the Internet.  Nomic has been used to stimulate artistic creativity, simulate the circulation of money, structure group therapy sessions, train managers, and to teach public speaking, legal reasoning, and legislative drafting.  Nomic games have sent ambassadors to other Nomic games, formed federations, and played Meta-Nomic.  Nomic games have experienced revolution, oppressive coups, and the restoration of popular sovereignty.  Above all, Nomic has been fun for thousands of players around the world.  For me, it was intended to illustrate and embody the thesis of my book, The Paradox of Self-Amendment, that a legal "rule of change" such as a constitutional amendment clause may apply to itself and authorize its own amendment.  (Nomic is the third appendix of the book.)

Given the description of a game as input, our system generates a command-line interface and Tcl/Tk graphical application that will solve it (in the strong sense), and then play it perfectly.

spring-alpha.org >>"spring_alpha" is a networked game system set in an industrialised council estate whose inhabitants are attempting to create their own autonomous society in contrast to that of the regime in which they live. The game serves as a "sketch pad" for testing out alternative forms of social practice at both the "narrative" level, in terms of the game story, and at a "code" level, as players are able to re-write the code that runs the simulated world. The original narrative is based on a series of drawings by Chad McCail, "Spring" and "Evolution is Not Over yet", which also shape the game's visual style. The original stories and images become a framework that is fleshed-out by people's own ideas and experiences. The basic aim of the game is to change the rules by which the society in that world runs. This is done through hacking and altering the code that simulates that world, creating new types of behaviour and social interaction. How effective this becomes depends on the players' ability to spread these new ideas into the society.

What makes RoR different to most simulators is its unique soft-body physics: vehicles chassis and wheels are simulated in real-time as flexible objects, giving the simulation an extremely accurate behavior, while allowing the vehicles to be simply specified by their structural composition, as a network of interconnected nodes (forming the chassis and the wheels). Crashing into walls or terrain can permanently deform a vehicle in a realistic manner. In addition to its unique soft-body physics, RoR also features an advanced flight model based on blade element theory, allowing the accurate simulation of any airplane, base on their physical dimensions and wing airfoils. It also features an accurate buoyancy model based on elemental pressure gradients, enabling boats with complex hulls to move realistically in the swell.

OpenSimulator.sf.net >>A 3D Simulator for autonomous robots    Most experimental AI/robotics research involves a simulation component. Typical simulations involve very simplified environments - often 2D environments with polygonal objects and circular robots. The aim of this project is to create a tool for higher-fidelity real-time simulations of autonomous mobile robots. Real-time simulation also allows hardware-in-the-loop simulations.  We're working toward a 3D simulator that uses OpenGL for real-time rendering of the robot environment as realistically as possible, including a physics engine to simulate dynamics in real-time (collision between arbitrary polyhedral objects with friction).
