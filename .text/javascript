narwhaljs.org >>Narwhal is a cross-platform, multi-interpreter, general purpose JavaScript platform. It aims to provide a solid foundation for building JavaScript applications, primarily outside the web browser. Narwhal includes a package manager, module system, and standard library for multiple JavaScript interpreters. Currently Narwhal's Rhino support is the most complete, but other engines are available too. Narwhal's standard library conforms to the CommonJS standard. It is designed to work with multiple JavaScript interpreters, and to be easy to add support for new interpreters. Wherever possible, it is implemented in pure JavaScript to maximize reuse of code among engines. Combined with Jack, a Rack-like JSGI compatible library, Narwhal provides a platform for creating server-side JavaScript web applications and frameworks such as Nitro.

zaach.github.com/jison >>Jison takes a context-free grammar as input and outputs a JavaScript file capable of parsing the language described by that grammar. You can then use the generated script to parse inputs and accept, reject, or perform actions based on the input. If you're familiar with Bison or Yacc, or other clones, you're almost ready to roll.

Mozilla.org/projects/tamarin >>The goal of the "Tamarin" project is to implement a high-performance, open source implementation of the ECMAScript 4th edition (ES4) language specification. The Tamarin virtual machine will be used by Mozilla within SpiderMonkey, the core JavaScript engine embedded in Firefox, and other products based on Mozilla technology. The code will continue to be used by Adobe as part of the ActionScript Virtual Machine within Adobe Flash Player.

"'Adobe's work on the new virtual machine is the largest contribution to the Mozilla Foundation since its inception," said Brendan Eich, chief technology officer, Mozilla Corporation, and creator of JavaScript. "Now web developers have a high-performance, open source virtual machine for building and deploying interactive applications across both Adobe Flash Player and the Firefox web browser. We're excited about joining the Adobe and Mozilla communities to advance ECMAScript.'"
