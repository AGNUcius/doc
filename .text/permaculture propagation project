The Permaculture Propagation Project uses the GNU General Public Law to help consumers internalize costs and own the chain of production for organic goods and services.

Subject: "Garden A Feedin"
My ideas complement and extend yours in these ways:


* Allow you to target businesses and governments that are interested in the landscaping and an appearance of goodness (helping the needy), but otherwise have no use of those outputs.

* Help insure a more continued employment through Service Contracts.

* Help you and your business avoid government interference and lower your tax liability by receiving a portion of your income as the outputs themselves which you would then use directly.  This is a form of Imputed Production that makes you appear less wealthy than you really are - since there are then no numbers to report.


===Target Markets
Businesses should not be overlooked, as they have large budgets and are always looking for a way to improve the (mostly false) notion that they care about something besides themselves.

You can take advantage of those Public Relations (PR) funds by helping to expose their contribution to the Greater-Good when they allow you to use their land and water to help Feed the Hungry through Local Production.

This similarly applies to mid and high income households that would like to appear more 'green' to their neighbors, but do not have the time or will to deal with those 'manufacturing' plants themselves.


Here is the approach in rough form:
A.) We will install beautiful yet productive plants for approximately the same price as non-productive plants.

B.) We will optionally contract with you to tend those plants and harvest the products in perpetutity at NO COST to you except we will retain some % of that harvest as payment.

C.) We will optionally process and store your % at NO COST to you except we will retain some further % of that harvest as payment.

D.) We will optionally prepare your % into advanced solutions, even fully prepared meals at NO COST to you except we will retain some % further of that harvest as payment.


===Vertical Integration
As you gain more of these Product-as-Payment Service Contracts, you will finally have more output than you or your employees can use directly.

At that point, you can begin using these raw materials as the inputs of other businesses such as creating Olive-oil, Almond-milk, Nut-based nutrition bars, etc.

Later, you can even open restaurants supplied by those outputs.


===Business Orientation
Because of the nature of your endeavor, a carefully written "Mission Statement" will qualify you as non-profit.

This would have NO EFFECT on the amount of money you or your workers can keep as reward, it only requires you call those rewards *Wages* instead of *Profit* - it is a simple matter of book-keeping.


===General Ideas
For trees, concentrate on high-oil products such as Avacado, Olive, Nut - as they are much more valuable (both nutritionally and monetarily) than fruit.

For small plants, don't forget spices and herbs, which are usually easy to grow, yet very expensive at the market.

Off-the-shelf dog houses might be a simple basis for small Chicken shelters.

Don't forget Bee Hives - informing potential customers of http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder to increase their moral imperative.
