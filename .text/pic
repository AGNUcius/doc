darktable.sf.net >>darktable is a photography workflow application: a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers: it manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw images and enhance them.  this project tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free raw converters and image management tools (such as e.g. ufraw, rawstudio, f-spot, digikam, shotwell). The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and mipmaps, all stored in a database. the main focus is on user interaction, both in terms of a smooth interface design as well as processing speed. high quality output is also one of our goals.

GQview-Win.sf.net >>I am always looking for a light and easy to use image viewer.  ACDSEE? It's good for browsing the images, but it is not free.  And, likes other successful windows software, it becomes fatter and fatter.  I hope the image viewer is just a viewer and don't want to use it as a photos modifier.  To modify the photo, GIMP is my favorite.  Finally, I found GQview.  It is excellent with so many great features.  Zoom, thumbnail, directories navigate and so on.  Especially the EXIF, what a wondeful feature! Besides, it is light.  But, it only works on Linux.  Why don't port it to windows?  After a few nights work.  GQview-win was borned.  It's not a complex port.  Also, it is not a big project.  It is just a convenient tool.  If you are interested, please help me to make it better.
