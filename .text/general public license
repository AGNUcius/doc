Answering http://GPLv3.FSF.org/wiki/index.php/Talk:Main_Page "'Who really is the YOU in the GPL?'"

My short answer is that the GPL is enforced between instance owners (who are initially also the workers) for the purpose of insuring Freedom for every User.  RMS and Moglen speak of "User Freedom", never of "Worker Freedom" or "Owner Freedom".

The GNU General Public License is not an EULA.  GPLv2 says "Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope."

DWheeler.com/blog/2006/09/01/#gpl-bsd >>Yes, companies could voluntarily cooperate without a license forcing them to.  The *BSDs try to depend on this.  But it today's cutthroat market, that's more like the "Prisoner's Dilemma".  In the dilemma, it's better to cooperate; but since the other guy might choose to not cooperate, and exploit your naivete, you may choose to not cooperate.  A way out of this dilemma is to create a situation where you must cooperate, and the GPL does that.

Wildstrom appearing in BusinessWeek online, entitled A Big Fly in the Open-Source Soup writes "How does software owned by everyone and by no one survive in a world where copyrights and patents shape the legal landscape?" But any open source software which becomes successful enough to be worthy of note attains that status while carrying this alleged disadvantage, so where's the crisis?
