WebJob.sf.net >>Incident response is fraught with constraints. Often, response handlers must work around the constraints imposed by the surrounding environment. For example, lack of physical or shell access, untrusted diagnostic programs, lack of encryption, many machines in need of investigation, et cetera. Therefore, tool designers need to take into account these issues and compensate, where possible. Further, tool builders need to design their tools with Daubert principles in mind. Specifically, such tools need to have open architectures and utilize open data formats so that other practitioners and tool builders may thoroughly understand and appreciate their operation.

OpenSourceForensics.org >>The Open Source Digital Forensics site is a reference for the use of open source software in digital investigations (a.k.a. digital forensics, computer forensics, incident response). Open source tools may have a legal benefit over closed source tools because they have a documented procedure and allow the investigator to verify that a tool does what it claims.

VolatileSystems.com/default/volatility >>The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools, implemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples. The extraction techniques are performed completely independent of the system being investigated but offer unprecedented visibilty into the runtime state of the system. The framework is intended to introduce people to the techniques and complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts from volatile memory samples and provide a platform for further work into this exciting area of research.

GMGSystemsINC.com/fau >>This is a collection of utilities and libraries intended for forensic or forensic-related investigative use in a modern Microsoft Windows environment.  The components in this collection are intended to permit the investigator to sterilize media for forensic duplication, discover where logical volume information is located and to collect the evidence from a running computer system while at the same time ensuring data integrity (e.g. with a cryptographic checksums) and while minimizing distortive alterations to the subject system.  The components of this package are not intended to preclude all changes to the subject system  while the evidence collection process is under way .  A third party hardware or software write blocker should be employed in those circumstances where it is deemed necessary to guarantee  that no changes occur to the subject volume prior to and after the imaging process.  

ForensicsWiki.org >>This is the Forensics Wiki, a Creative Commons-licensed wiki devoted to information about digital forensics (also known as computer forensics). We currently list a total of 539 pages.  Much of computer forensics is focused on the tools and techniques used by investigators, but there are also a number of important papers, people, and organizations involved. Many of those organizations sponsor conferences throughout the year and around the world. You may also wish to examine the popular journals and some special reports.

Dutch National Police Agency. See http://www.politie.nl/overige/English/ for more information.

The Open Computer Forensics Architecture (OCFA) is a modular computer forensics framework built by the Dutch National Police Agency. The main goal is to automate the digital forensic process to speed up the investigation and give tactical investigators direct access to the seized data through an easy to use search and browse interface.

The architecture forms an environment where existing forensic tools and libraries can be easily plugged into the architecture and can thus be made part of the recursive extraction of data and metadata from digital evidence.

The Open Computer Forensics Architecture aims to be highly modular, robust, fault tolerant, recursive and scalable in order to be usable in large investigations that spawn numerous terabytes of evidence data and covers hundreds of evidence items.
