sf.net/projects/LibMSocket >>libmsocket is a socket abstraction library in C, which aims to support as many protocol abstractions transparently as possible. Current goals include SSL and Socks5 proxies. At its core, libmsocket makes developing socket applications very easy, even if you're not using any of those abstractions at all. It also ties in to libevent for I/O multiplexing and asynchronous DNS resolution.
