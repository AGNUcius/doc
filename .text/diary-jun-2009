Jun-18-2009: Thinking about 2 very different targets for currency issuance:

 (1) A "Title of Ownership" over a *specific instance* of some physical sources of production.  For example: 74% ownership in the Peach tree located at GPS coordinates X.  This is issued by the current owner and must be offered (probably as a 'receipt') to any customer that paid more than cost.

 (2) A "Promise to Pay" the work required to achieve some quantity and quality of Goods or Services within some window of time.  This is issued by someone intending worker


This is the basis of the two-sided PSF "Product Future".

Jun-11-2009:
Thinking about the apparent invalidity of a "Consumer Owned" enterprise because it seems to ignore the plight of the Worker.

But 'Worker' and 'Consumer' are roles we each play, not independent groups that should battle!

'Owner' is another important role.  We must each fill ALL 3 of these roles in the GNU enconomy.

But what is a better title?  "Payer Owned", "Payer as Investor" ... "Payer Profit"?

Hi Permafacture,

I understand a Payer sees profit as a Cost, but I'm talking about the 'popular' definition of these terms that are written from the point-of-view of the Owners of the Means of Production.

http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost says "'Usually, the price also includes a mark-up for profit over the cost of production.'"

So, to avoid confusion, I will stop using these bare terms, and instead prepend an 'identifier' that will keep our thinking more clear.

The following relations are equivalent:

Payer_Price == Owner_Costs + Owner_Profit
Owner_Profit == Payer_Price - Owner_Costs
Owner_Costs == Payer_Price - Owner_Profit


So, Owner_Profit is not an Owner_Cost of production, it is the amount the Owners receive ABOVE the Owner_Costs of production.

Owner_Profit is the DIFFERENCE between Payer_Price and Owner_Costs.


From the Payer's point-of-view, once the transaction is made, a Payer's_Price paid becomes his own "Owner_Cost", even though it also contains Owner_Profits paid to those other Owners.

For example:
    Say the Owner of a "pin factory" buys steel as an input of production.  He will pay a Payer_Price which includes both Owner_Costs AND Owner_Profit, but from HIS point-of-view, that purchase is simply an Owner_Cost because he cannot avoid paying it.

But wait, there IS a way to avoid it.

A Payer can escape paying Owner_Profit by becoming the Owner of THAT production too.  So, if the Owner of a "pin factory" owned the steel mines and smelters (or whatever) and all the equipment needed for THAT production, then he would still have to pay Owner_Costs (including wages), but would no longer pay Owner_Profits, since who would he possibly pay them to?


> Perhaps that cost is money owed to investors

Yes, this is a problem with WHO we choose as investors.  If the investors were potential Consumers, and were investing for the purpose of *Owner_Product* instead of Owner_Profit, then we could pay them in product instead.

For example, would you be willing to invest (pre-pay) $100 toward owning shares in a Cell-Phone company (co-owned with say 999,999 other people) that would then provide you with "at cost" service?

Your Payer_Price would be far lower since you would then be paying only Owner_Costs while avoiding the 'leak' of Owner_Profit.  If we want to know how much more efficient this is, all we need to do is look at the 'earnings' of Sprint, Nextel, etc. to see what we would not be paying.

> money needed to offset inflation

We are so accustomed to the idea that inflation cannot be avoided.

Who issues the currency for your nation?

Is it your (corrupt, and so there is another level of trouble)government, or is it a cabal of private, offshore bankers?

If you live in the USA (and nearly every other country on earth), that currency is issued (as disturbances on magentic media) by private bankers who then buy US Bonds on the open market - bonds that, from what I understand, are largely backed by the land of our national forests and other irreplacable assets.

The National Debt is a direct result of this sham that is so filthy and backward it can hardly be believed or even comprehended why we (the people) would not just issue our own currency as some presidents (Lincoln, Kennedy) tried and were murderd because of.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110

We are loosing ownership of the ground beneath our feet because we BORROW those electronic blips instead of issuing them ourselves.  God (if there were one) we are dumb.


> or to re-invest into expansion and development of the operation.

Yes, this is a good point.  I agree Owner_Profit should be used to pay for growth, but my contention here is that the Ownership of those new investments should be (or become as they 'vest') the Property of the person who *PAID* it - so that each Payer (consumer) slowly gains ownership in the Means of Production according to the amount he is willing and able to pay above Owner_Costs until his Payer_Price approaches and even can reach Owner_Costs.

CEOs are paid excessive wages (which are booked as Owner_Costs) because the pool of owners is not diversified enough to thwart such stupidity.

The other owners either do not have any real control (blind investors such as those buy Mutual Funds, etc.), or they are controlling owners that do not complain because they also receive similar handouts.

Perfect Competition would eliminate all Owner_Profit, but Perfect Competition will occur only when every Payer has sufficient Ownership in the Means of Production needed to escape that payment.

Are you saying no business ever collects Owner_Profit?

If so, then what is it they report as 'earnings' at the end of each quarter?

"Collectively run" operations are inevitibly owned by a small group of workers, not by those who Pay for the product thereof, so are essentially the same as Capitalists, since their goal is also to keep Payer_Price above Owner_Costs.

I'm trying to multiplex property ownership across those finally use the outputs of that production so they can have ultimate control at minimum Payer_Price.

As a side-effect, maximizing competition minimizes Owner_Profit - even to the point of 0!

But that is OK when the investors are the same group that will be satisfied with "at cost" Product, for then we can all win instead of being a culture that requires late-comers perpetually pay more than Owner_Costs as some sort of 'reward' for the current owners while the late-comers remain dependent upon them.

This artificial scarcity and artificial expense of capital reduces the bargaining power of labor, and thereby affects the rate of profit on industrial capital. For Marxists, the rate of interest derives from the rate of profit; for individualist anarchists, the reverse is true. And if Bauwens and other advocates of peer money are not individualist anarchists, they share the same understanding that the structure of money itself affects the exploitative character of capitalist production.

It also entails eliminating unnecessary costs of physical production.

Of course I am not suggesting that work towards a new monetary system should be abandoned in the p2p community. I just don't see the point. I would like to focus my inquiries on the question how the p2p community can contribute to a fairer system of monetary exchange for labour (= value)

For the purposes of local economies, it is more important as a measure of value for facilitating exchange. Local currencies, LETS systems and other barter networks, provide liquidity to facilitate exchange of future products or services between ordinary producers who may not have accumulated stores of past value. Local currencies enable producers to directly exchange their wares within a network, without the intermediary of conventional money from the outside capitalist economy.

They are, rather, advanced from current production by some workers against future production by other workers. The same function, of coordinating exchange of future products, could be carried out cooperatively by workers themselves. By preempting the function and monopolizing it through a state-privileged banking system, the capitalist or financier is able to collect tribute for it.

And the more steps in the circuit, the more likely it is to be broken, and the more likely the realization of labor (the transformation of labor into use-value, through the indirect means of exchanging one's own labor for wages, and exchanging those wages for use-value produced by someone else's labor) is to fail. When we participate in the capitalist economy, we must first obtain money by either selling our services to a capitalist wage employer or amassing the startup capital for a high-overhead, high-risk conventional business to sell one's services to the customer. Then we take the money and use it to hire the services of others, with the a major part of the price going to the overhead costs of a conventional capitalist enterprise, and the capitalist employer perhaps taking his cut as well. Local money systems, by promoting direct exchange between producers, eliminate many of the insecurities and uncertainties of the capitalist economy. By reducing the intermediate steps between production and consumption, they also reduce the contingency involved in consumption.

Jun-08-2009: Thoughts on careful word usage and role playing...
The terms 'consumer' and 'producer' confuse our analysis by anthromorphosizing these economic roles.

Except for dependents, every actor is both a consumer AND a producer.

Consumption and production and are actions we take, not opposing groups that compete.

There is no such thing as a worker that does not eat, nor are there eaters that do not work.

An actor may produce a good which he does not consume.
An actor may consume a good which he did not produce.

Most actors do both.  They consume the product of others while producing for others.

They also likely produce some of what they consume, but that is not economically interesting.

We each and all must complete both of these tasks.

Ownership in the Means of Production is not a question of "which group should have", but a question of "what actions should cause".
