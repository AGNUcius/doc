Are you saying it didn't help even a little?  Gah!

A summary of my response to your other mail is:

We (any business owner applying the trade agreement I so often allude to) don't want to hold Consumer_Price at Owner_Cost directly, as price above cost measures the amount the Consumer is willing to invest.

Instead of selling the apples "at cost", we will sell them at "whatever the market will bear" and use the amount usually designated as profit to invest for that consumer in sources to guarantee future production incrementally comes under his control through real ownership.  There is also the matter of delayed 'handoff' that we might call 'vesting'.

Again, it is important that we charge as high a price as possible to essentially 'force' the citizen/consumer to invest for their own good.

Also, the current owners never lose ownership of anything they want to retain.  If they don't want help paying off their current investments, the new consumer investments go toward purchasing more land, trees, water rights, etc., hopefully even nearer to the consumer that paid.

A consumer can receive "at cost" objects only *after* they are source owners in direct proportion to the amount they consume, and only then because profit becomes 'undefined' except as their own further investment.

Maybe you meant to say "not really practical to INDIVIDUALLY own".  Obviously it can be practical for SOMEONE to own (re)sources; you even reference them when you say "we pay other owners".  I imagine you are referring to regular business owners in that case.

It is practical for a group of investors to COLLECTIVELY own expensive physical sources, and it can even be practical for a small business owner to INDIVIDUALLY own expensive physical sources as long as those (re)sources are kept 'busy' across many consumers so the continuous costs of ownership are 'shared' among those consumers.

This is a matter of utilization similar to the scheduling and allocation routines for an OS kernel.

The owner of a rental agency or an aerating service can INDIVIDUALLY purchase the expensive physical sources: not only the aerator, but also a building for storage and maintenance, the land for that building, a truck and trailer to transport the device, tools, fuel, repair parts, etc. as long as there are enough consumers to cover the initial and recurring costs of that ownership.

The sole owner of a very small business might be the only worker.  He may be the operator, mechanic, cashier, advertiser, scheduler all at once.  He will pay himself a wage arbitrarily separated from profit - probably according to how it effects his taxes.

But when the ownership is COLLECTIVE, the separation of wage from profit is not so arbitrary.  If a part-owner tries to claim too high wage for some work he does, the other part-owners might vote to hire that position to someone who will do it for less.

As the business grows, the owners will hire other non-owning workers and pay them wages calculated as another cost.

What I have written so far applies to either a traditional "Capitalistic" for-profit corporation or to a "Source Freedom" for-product corporation.  The difference comes in WHO comprises the set called 'owners'.  The question is "What is the optimal composition of the source owners?", or maybe "WHAT ACTIONS should cause, or to WHOM should ownership 'flow'?".

Once we determine who *should* be the owners, we only need write a contract and apply it to some of our own physical sources to implement the theory on a small scale.  If we are correct, then it will outperform and overgrow standard Capitalism because it will simply be more efficient.  This is also how the GNU General Public License works: investors (programmers investing time and effort in the case of software) retain just enough ownership (copyright) to enforce the requirement that object consumers (object-code users) gain ownership of the sources (a copy of the source-code) whenever they receive an object - whether that object was a gift, or if they paid for it.


===There are at least 3 choices:
1. It DOESN'T MATTER who owns.  This is how most modern corporations are constructed.  Investors commonly have nothing to do this the product, and in many cases (such as with mutual funds), small-time investors may not even know the names of the corporations or what they produce.

2. The WORKERS own.  This is common for very small businesses, and is also the solution Karl Marx and many others dream as being optimal to avoid "worker exploitation".

3. The CONSUMERS own.  This is the pattern that Richard Stallman talks about with regard to virtual sources (non-rivalrous information such as source-code or genetics or mechanical design) and is held in place by the GNU General Public License.  This is of course also the goal of the GNU General Public Law meant to be applied to physical sources that have or will have more than one owner.

===Consumer Ownership Example:
What if you could somehow organize with 100 or so neighbors to jointly purchase an aerator?  Obviously you would each still need to pay your portion of the costs that a normal aerator business owner would pay (investment, fuel/oil, storage, upkeep, insurance, etc.) and would also pay wages (maybe even hiring one of the owners) for work such as maintenance, security guard, and also to an operator if you don't want to or can't run the machine yourself.  A portion for some of those costs (such as some types of wear) will be paid as rent and will vary according to (be weighted against) the amount you use the machine, while others (such as storage) will be paid as a periodic tax and will vary according to your percentage of ownership.

Another type of cost we might call 'exclusion' is strangely similar to profit in that it is based on high simultaneous demand.  This cost is special because it increases according to the apparent need to invest in more of that type of physical source.  This occurs when new consumers overload the current availability or when too many consumers want to use the machine at one time instead of being satisfied to wait until a later time.  Impatient consumers 'prove' they are willing to pay for another aerator instead of using what is already available at another time (earlier or later in the day or earlier or later in the year) when they drive up the price by 'bidding' against other potential consumers for a time slot.  The winning consumer pays a price higher than the total of all other costs (very similar to what is usually called profit).  That 'extra' payment will be that consumer's investment toward purchasing yet another aerator since it indicates a desire for growth because peak demand is not yet being fulfilled.

When the collective object(ive) consumers are also the physical source owners, paying price above cost (profit) becomes meaningless except as further investment.

I also posted about sharing aerators a couple months ago at Blog.P2PFoundation.net/the-call-for-open-social-networks-is-getting-louder-and-louder/2007/09/07

Here is a relevant excerpt:
When users (consumers) pay a PRICE for some good or service, they are paying for the COSTS of production that the capital Owners incurred for that round of production, and those users usually also pay an amount above COSTS which is (in a simplified manner) generally calculated as PROFIT.

PROFIT is therefore the difference between Consumer_Price and Owner_Costs, and is a rough measure of incomplete monopoly. In other words, profit is an inverse measure of competition, and is ‘balanced’ or even eliminated when it becomes an investment for the User that just paid it.

I will quote myself to fix a typo and to begin an example as Michel suggested to try to prove that it is the Consumers and NOT the Workers that must be the Owners of physical sources for us to approach a perfected economy:

"Owning expensive capital with a group of other users is valuable even when none of you can operate it because you can always hire that work done - and would treat those wages as a cost of operation, but could never pay profit unless you were to pay it to yourselves."

Let’s say a worker comes to your door asking to aerate your lawn. Aerators are generally too expensive to own for just one lawn, but you need the job done, so you agree to pay the PRICE of $30.

The PRICE includes the COSTS of:
  Investment: If the Owner has not yet recovered the price he paid for the machine.
  Maintenance: Wear, Oil, Fuel
  Wages: Whatever the worker and owner negotiate.

The PRICE also includes PROFIT for the Owner that instantly increases the moment the capital has been “paid off”.

Now, if you and a bunch of your neighbors got together to buy your OWN aerator, you would still have all the same COSTS as mentioned above which could be covered by each of you renting the machine from the collective others, but PROFIT would have no meaning, as PRICE and COSTS would be identical.  Furthermore, when the machine was finally “paid off”, the rental PRICE would fall even further, as that COST would be eliminated.

Poverty is a continum that most everyone participates in.  Extreme poverty means you cannot meet even your most basic needs.  While some humans are incapable of fending for themselves, or have given up because of past attempts and failures in a system designed to keep them oppressed, I am not addressing those case at this time.  The poverty I am referring to is the low "standard of living" or poor "quality of life" had by so many of the very hardest workers.

Poverty is held in place 'naturally' when objects are truly scarce (there aren't enough coconuts to feed everyone on the island, even if we share nicely).

But for-profit owners also hold poverty in place 'artificially' in two ways: initially by keeping objects too expensive (owners hold price above cost without treating that profit as consumer investment in more sources) and finally by holding sources artificially scarce in that owners pay wages lower than what consumers would pay those same workers or the consumers would rather do the work themselves but are not allowed source access.

So profit requires poverty through high prices and low wages:
1. Profit depends upon keeping price above cost.  As a consumer pays profit that is treated as physical source investment, he approaches "at cost" access to the output or objects of those sources: food/drugs, housing, cloth, soap, etc.  The potential to profit against a consumer is lost as that consumer crawls out of poverty when gaining source ownership because an object consumer who owns the sources of those objects will only pay cost, and since profit is defined as "price above cost", profit relies upon poverty at the point-of-sale BY DEFINITION.

2. Profit also somewhat depends upon keeping wages lower than the worker deserves by making the separation from profit different from what the consumer would make (the consumer pays both profit and wage either way, the difference is in the separation).  The more physical sources a consumer collectively owns, the less they need to worry about working for another because they can just work for themselves for product, and hence can demand higher wages when working for others (all workers are also consumers).

That reminds me of the "greedy" search algorithm we learned about in CS and how it is sometime sub-optimal.  This is also related to the Nash Equilibrium or the Prisoner’s Dilemma - where an individual may choose a payoff that is not the best for the group, but is better than the worst for himself; maybe out of fear or because there wasn’t a prior arrangement that could have ensured the other party would also be bound to choose the best alternative.

Addressing mortgages is especially difficult (but not impossible), as it will require us to purchase some land outside of a city and make a completely new city with the local tax (rent) system weighted against exclusion and other real costs instead weighting against improvements.

Addressing insurance is an integral part of the GNU General Public Law and can be understood as physical source ownership being a hedge against future calamity.  For instance, you can insure your car by having ownership in a repair shop and in supporting the education and wages of mechanics for that shop.  Health insurance is had by owning controlling shares in a hospital and in supporting the education and wages for doctors and nurses and also by investing in pharmaceutical research (done whenever you pay more than cost for drugs) and procedural research (done whenever you pay more than cost for procedures), etc.

Sorry for the length of this.  I tried to keep it short, but I'm so often misunderstood I decided to some redundance might help.

Call me anytime at 801-602-4651 if you have long or short thoughts or questions.

Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to work on this.  I am preparing a reply to your other mail, and should be done within the next few days.

Ownut writes:

Applying Source Freedom through the GNU General Public Law to an object and the physical sources of that object is not imaginary, it is realistic and legal in the same way that applying the GNU General Public License to "object code" and the virtual sources ("source code") is accomplished: it only occurs when private owners choose to apply it to their own property.

The GNU GPLicense is only applicable to non-rivalrous, copyrightable information or in other words 'virtual' objects such as software, DNA (genetics), mechanical design, music, video, etc.

But GNU GPLaw is applied to pure information such as software, genetics or mechanical design AND to the rivalrous physical objects such as the DVD, apple or an aerator that are required to 'host' that information.

The GNU GPLicense requires the virtual sources (source code) be made available "at cost" to any user that receives a copy of a virtual object (executable) whether the user pays a fee for the object or not.

The GNU GPLaw governs the virtual sources of any object with the GNU GPLicense, and ALSO requires the user (consumer) gain ownership in the physical sources by treating any price above cost as an investment from the user that paid it.

So let's say I start a Source Freedom business/community center in which I voluntarily place all the objects and their physical sources under the GNU General Public Law.

Here are some of the transactions that might occur there:

1. Sell consumable physical objects such as: apples, almonds, honey...
2. Rent durable physical objects such as: aerator, floor space, grill/oven, mini theater, popcorn machine, car/truck...
3. Hire skilled workers such as cooks, cashiers, shelf stockers, orchard tending...
4. Enable skilled workers to offer their services directly to other customers.

None of this is charity.  Everything would be either sold or rented at the highest price the consumer is willing to pay.  A consumer paying more than cost is simply communicating that they need ownership in the physical sources of that object[ive].

I use the term "Owner Cost" or sometimes just "cost" to represent what you call here the "price of production".

I do not suggest we (anyone selling a GPL object or service) should artificially hold the "Consumer Price" down at the "Owner Cost".  In fact it is important that we DON'T do this, and that we charge what the "market will bear" since the difference between price and cost (what is usually called 'profit') is a good measure of how much the consumer is in need of investment, so should be gathered from them for the purpose of growth.

Yes, that is right.  There is no need to say (somehow), as it can be done by any owner that is willing to do so.  There are such things as Not-For-Profit corporations right?  They don't *require* profit to exist, in fact the excess money is sometimes a bit of a problem for them.

What I am talking about is similar except we simply stipulate at the time the corporation forms that the destination of those funds will be an investment for the consumer that paid them.

There are some details about the "increased ownership" that can be confusing: Current owners are never in danger of losing control that they do not offer up for investment.  If an owner wants to keep full control of an orchard, then the profit (consumer investment) would target NEW land, trees, tools, etc. - hopefully in a location even closer to the consumer's home.

> Now, I don't have an apple tree (or, do I?  are

Again, this is not an imaginary situation.  I understand (just as Richard Stallman understood) that current laws cannot be changed from the top down because we simply don't have the funds to purchase those changes (to be as cynical as we must in order to fully understand the kettle we are in).

The GNU GPL utilizes the current legal system (copyright in the case of virtual sources, and private property law in the case of physical sources) to help private owners to ADD the constraints needed to keep the Nash Equilibrium in place.

Again, Joe would charge you as much as possible which would likely be above operation costs since you are not yet an owner, so have few alternatives.

But to address the other part of this question, I think Joe *could* determine the operation costs at any moment by examining the costs over the previous 364 days plus today instead of arbitrarily breaking the year at January 1st.

Joe will charge a price *above* cost whenever he can.  Real scarcity is the natural reason consumers should be investing.  The "price above cost" (what is usually called profit) that those consumers pay will become their investments in yet more land and trees and water rights so competition is perfected (though never quite perfect because of the dynamic nature of consumers).  This causes growth to wax and wane according to consumer demand as it should and distributes control among those that deserve it.

Joe will set "Consumer Price" at whatever the "market will bear", or in other words, Joe will simply be competing with other growers.

They will each sell at whatever the "market will bear", which will be "price above cost" for as long as object consumers are not yet source owners in direct proportion to the amount they consume.

Frank's higher quality may allow a higher "Consumer Price", and his lower costs will also mean there is more profit (remember, wages are a cost), so his orchard will cause more growth than Joe's.  That is a GOOD thing, since we want skilled workers to succeed in their field and unskilled to fail so they move to profession where they fit.

The better worker should 'win' for the benefit of the community as a whole.

Again, you will most likely purchase at a price above cost.

That overpayment is your investment in more physical sources such as land, trees, water rights and tools - or toward paying off some of Joe's investments if he is offering them up for sale.  The decision is initially up to Joe, but there needs to be some kind of delayed 'vesting' or "hand off" that I still don't know the details.  Hopefully you can help with this 'bug'.

>  Am I now a part owner in Joe's orchard?

Joe may have been applying your investments to an new orchard far from the one that produced your apples, or may have applied it toward paying off some of his previous investments.

If Joe applied those funds into paying off some of his own trees, then there comes the complication of access:

1. Either he must be also incrementally selling you the land under those trees and guaranteeing "at cost" access to them,
2. Or he must be guaranteeing "at cost" or "pass through" costs for your rental of those parcels for a time reasonably coincident to the life of that tree.
3. There are other probably other issues/bugs that need to be exposed.

> If so, how do I protect my
> "investment" if Joe decides to burn down his rotten trees because they

Joe has no legal authority over YOUR property.  Before the "hand off" period that I mentioned - before your shares have 'vested' he may re-allocate those investments to some other land or toward a different tractor or toward other trees, etc. but you are becoming a real owner of physical sources SOMEWHERE.

The investments you make when paying price above costs become your real property that you have vote-weight in direct proportion to the % you own in "realistically divisible" granularity.  I need to write more about this.

This will be more loose than it sounds because the community currency that is issued against those physical sources (that I call GNUrho) become a sort of retargetable "Deed of Ownership" and "Insurance Title" that I will write about at another time if you are interested.

Oct-15-2007: Thinking more about Blog.P2PFoundation.net/video-lessig-on-corruption/2007/10/10

Most agree that sugar and drugs (two of Lessig's examples) are useful when used with care.  Of course we need products, but some groups (corporations) want to trick the rest of us into consuming more than we really need.  This is bad for our health, our environment and our personal finances.

This artifical pressure to consume is not part of all groups.  When people are truly cooperating they want just the opposite; they want each to consume as little as possible so there is enough for the others and so there is generally less work to be done.  But when we are not cooperating, this goal is INVERTED by the 'producers' who are seeking a prize beyond the immediate results of production.

Uncooperative producers also seek to increase scarcity and dependence.  How could we have gotten these fundamental goals backward?  Where or how do we go astray from our original goals of abundance and freedom?

Part of the difficulty in understanding the problem is the number of variables and overwhelming complexity of a large modern society.  But economic truths are continuous.  We should be able to begin with the minimal case of a small set of isolated humans trying to cooperate for their own sake and slowly scale it up until we see where it 'breaks'.

So let's say a small group of people is interested in starting an independent community (whether a commune or maybe some stranded islanders or even some planet pioneers) intending to produce their own food, housing, clothing, sugar, drugs, etc..  It is almost certain that most of those individuals will want to trade some of their skills with some of the others because of the increased efficiency that specialization brings.


Such a small group may have little or no difference between the rules of governance for their 'State' and the management decisions for the 'Corporate' activity because they are all "on the same side".  This could be thought of as a type of Corporatism (the mixture of corporation and state) that is natural and good.  That is right, government and business are naturally and safely COMBINED under certain conditions that usually appear when the group is very small and isolated because the goals are the same.

Capitalism tends to assume consumer goals as asserted by and producer goals must be SEPARATE and at odds with one another.

State-run Communism tries to rectify this by keeping business and government COMBINED but under centralized control.

Another (for now unnamed) approach keeps business and government COMBINED by assuming all collective ownership will act as a public utility for that good or service by insuring each consumer gains

But none of that explains WHY groups do this, only that they do.

Oh, forget it, I'll just tell you what is too blasphemous for anyone else to say:

The only reason the goals of these groups are inverted from abundance and freedom toward scarcity and oppression is because PROFIT is being misunderstood as a prize to be won against those that are not already developed, instead of being treated as an investment (in more productive sources) from the consumer that just paid it.

When profit (the difference between Object_Consumer_Price and Source_Owner_Costs) is thought to be value added by owners, the owners that receive it are incented to work against the consumer in a variety of ways, including the overproduction of sugar for the sake of profit itself, while the original goal of PRODUCT is forgotten.

When the consumer of an object (say an apple) is also the source owner (of the land, tree and water rights), there is no reason to worry if your neighbor is growing apples, and you don't try to overconsume, as your goal is product, not profit.

But when an owner begins selling objects to non-owning consumers, the amount they charge above costs (wages being one of those costs) is an indication of that consumer's DEPENDENCE (remember Lessig's use of this word) on that owner. That difference (usually called profit) should be considered an INVESTMENT from that consumer. By doing this, competition is maximized (every consumer becomes a partial owner) and profit is indirectly eliminated (you can't meaningfully charge more than cost to yourself unless you are investing in more trees).

Treating owner profit as consumer investment also distributes control at each transaction so governance becomes decentralized and non-representational. Once this is in place, business and government can be recombined, as their goals will be identical!

That's right, it creates a valid and useful form of Corporatism (the mixture of corporation and state) because there is no longer a conflict of interests when profit is understood to be a consumer's plea for growth, and is treated as such.

I thought you might mean that. The conundrum has already been cracked by many. While I like discussion as much as the next guy, there is a wealth of information out there. I think Part 1 of Capitalism 3.0 by Peter Barnes is a good brief primer on the problem: http://capitalism3.com/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf

Further investigation will take you to economists such as Joe Stiglitz and the role of information asymmetry.

In short, there is a systemic problem, to quote the quote of a quote:

In the article "Summary: What P2P Means for the World of Tomorrow" [2007] Michel Bauwens delineates the current counterproductive logic of social organisation:

a) it is based on a false concept of abundance in the limited material world; it has created a system based on infinite growth, within the confines of finite resources

b) it is based on a false concept of scarcity in the infinite immaterial world; instead of allowing continuous experimental social innovation, it purposely erects legal and technical barriers to disallow free cooperation through copyright, patents, etcetera

I hope these materials help you dig deeper. You may find it helpful to turn your question on its head: how could a system built on these false concepts act toward the best interests of a cooperative community?

By "inverted drive" I was asking why the goals of so many corporations are in disagreement with the rest of humanity; I wasn't calling Lessig's efforts inverted.

Lessig's goals are fine at the level they question, but I would like to go deeper.

Instead of accepting a-priori that ALL corporations (groups of people) must ALWAYS act against society, I'm asking WHY corporate goals tend to be inverted from those of a cooperative community, especially as that corporation grows.

This may seem too stupid a question, but the FULL answer continues to elude my ability to put it in words.

Whoever is reading this, please write a little - even if just a few words that come to your mind - almost as a Rorschach Test so we can collaboratively crack this conundrum.

Patrick,

Unless you assume that the state and public authorities will disappear tommorow, struggling to make them more accountable to civil society, rather than to the corporations, continues to make sense. This does not preclude a continued effort for a more autonomous civil society and peer governance, but transgressive behaviour alone is not enough, if it is not combined by a judicious combination of constructive new-world creation and engagement for changing the existing institutional base.

So Lessig's efforts make a lot of sense in that context.

Michel

Why do corporations act against society?

Asking government representatives to stop this pressure at the gate seems a tall order.

Can anyone tell me what generates this inverted drive?


Oct-15-2007: Posted to Lessig.org/blog/2007/10/corruption_lecture_alpha_versi_1.html
We seem to accept that all corporations will act against society, and then want our 'leaders' to stop them "at the gate".

I would like to take a step back and ask:

Why do corporations, especially as they succeed, tend to take courses that do not serve the consumer (citizen)?

Is it impossible to construct an organization (whether corporate or governmental) that continues to serve only the consumers (citizens), even as it grows?

Why do small groups (say on a deserted island) not attack each other in such blatant ways? What changes as the number of humans increases?

If some humans collectively purchased some land and capital (Sources of Production) dedicated to being a true utility for the public, what would they need to do differently to insure the cooperation would continue?

Oct-11-2007: Distributism.BlogSpot.com/2007/09/libertarianism-and-distributism.html >>Several radical strands of classical liberalism, including some self-identified socialists, drew radical conclusions from Ricardo's observation that the income of landlords and capitalists came from value produced by labor.  The radical direction in which they took their free market philosophy was just this: if the natural tendency of a free market is for labor to receive its full product, then the fact that labor does not receive its full product under existing capitalism can only result from privilege.  Capitalism, as distinguished from a free market, is a system in which the state represents the owners of capital and land and intervenes in the market on their behalf.  Its enforcement of special privileges keeps land and capital artificially scarce and expensive in comparison to labor, so that labor must pay tribute for access to the means of production.  Let, therefore, the state remove its guarantees of privilege, and let the suppliers of land and capital compete in a free market without entry barriers, and land and capital will cease to draw monopoly returns; the wage of labor will rise to its full product.

The Open Source model (and more importantly, the Free Software movement), does not conflict with with the 'righteous' goals of commercial activity [ see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html ], it only makes proprietary activity difficult.

Source Freedom does not stop commerce, it only stops the artificial scarcity used to perpetuate profit. This subjugation is enforced by disallowing the consumer "at cost" access to the Means of Production (for software this is primarily the source-code) so the consumer cannot "go around" the producers, but are instead at the mercy of those that were there first.

The GNU GPL is especially important in this regard because of the way it disallows re-proprietization while still allowing privacy.

This will be generalized into the physical realm when we finally understand profit to be an investment from the consumer that pays it.

>> 3) Be off the grid, using a hybrid power solution (solar, wind, hydro) as well as passive solar design
>> 4) Have water rights to sufficient clean water for drinking, cleaning, irrigation, etc.
>> 5) Grow 70+% of the food my family consumes.  Garden, Orchard, Greenhouse, Fish Pond.  Canning and preserving.
>>
>> The two biggest hurdles to accomplishing this are:
>>
>> 1) Getting the land.  This one's the kicker, 'cause good land is not cheap.  I think it's very likely that StorageCraft will be acquired within the next two years.  I believe that my share , after the acquisition, will be sufficient to finance this.  So I'm really hoping to get the ball rolling on all this within two years.
>> 2) Convincing Heather that we can be happy when we're more than 15 minutes from a Target.  It's going to be a real challenge to move my family out to a rural setting.  The further away from urban life, the harder it will be to convince her.  I'm pretty sure that in order for me to actually accomplish these goals I'm going to have to develop the homestead as a vacation property initially - develop it slowly and not live there full time (which may make it VERY difficult to develop) and only move there permanently after it's well established and/or Heather wants to move to the homestead.  She's convinced that our kids would hate it, but I believe that as long as we had good neighbors it wouldn't matter if our kids had to walk for 5 minutes to get to their house, they would still have friends.  I'm also pretty sure that they'd enjoy that life style.
