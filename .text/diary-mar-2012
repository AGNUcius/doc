Mar-12-2012: Physical Salvation as the true Purpose of Religion

==Plea
We, the people, must be the change we seek.
We will replace corporation and government.

We will buy land and water-rights and tools and plants
and animals needed for reproduction of our daily bread.

But we must structure ourselves differently from within
lest we grow into yet another head of that deadly beast.


==Summary
Production requires both material and immaterial Sources.

===Definitions
Material Sources (MS) include the surface-area, water,
living organisms, tools, energy needed to produce our
food, medicine, soap, cloth, building materials, etc.

Immaterial Sources (IS) are things such as such as software
or hardware design or genetics or 3D models and other media.

Products are the goods and services we need.


===The GNU Pattern
The GNU GPL is a sort of trade-agreement between the owners
of IS which protects Product Users by requiring those users
gain at-cost access to the IS of that production.

This may seem useless, since most Users do not know how to
use the IS.  In other words, most Users are not Developers
of that exact Product, and so what would they do with the
Source-Code or DNA or design documents?

Of course some Users will study the IS and hopefully learn
how to make their own Products.

But the more significant impact of Users gaining at-cost
access to Sources is how it reduces the barriers to entry.

Now the User can hire any Worker, because the Sources are
almost all that is needed for production to begin.

Our vision of a Worker-Owned world is nothing more than absolute Capitalism - where everyone is pitted against everyone else.

Every worker is a consumer who's inputs must be secured.
But our needs are the

==Swapping Skills

====Scheduling
Property ownership is not "worth it" if it is not being used.
We already have this problem with capital being almost continuously idle.

Production requires we share Sources and swap Skills.
1.) Property ownership in land and water rights.
2.) Heirloom plants and animals for food, medicine, soap, cloth, building materials.
3.) Tools, and eventually the tools to make tools.
4.) Skills applied to these Sources to create Products.

We cannot solve such an ancient and continuing problem without understanding why we fail.


==Sharing Sources and Swapping Skills

Committing to achieve specific goals in the future is the workers' Promise to Pay.

Allocation


Profit is a growth-vector we can 'reflect' toward the payer as his investment in even more Means of Production - so the growth of the organization is continuously redistributed to those willing to pay for the growth and then continuation of that production.

We can change the system from within by regaining control of production.
This is an ancient and continuing struggle for our planet.

==The Problem with Production
Production is already taking place, but it is controlled by those who seek profit.
But to seek profit is to seek scarcity, because profit *requires* scarcity.


As a farm-boy in Idaho, my dad told me about a US government program that pays farmers to keep land out of production to increase scarcity so price remains above costs.

Those farmers, and most all entrepreneurs are in such debt that most of the profits are passed along to bankers.


To seek Profit is to accidentally seek scarcity.



They pool their resources, but instead of using

There is another reason for production that is

Non-profit corporations and organizations have many of the same problems because they do not direct profit

We must buy, co-own and occupy the property required to host the production of our continuing needs.

We must host the housing and food production and child-care and health-care and transportation and *everything* that

> The Cook Unit is redeemable in product or service.



Working Capital Partnership ("Guarantee Society")


that includes workers and consumers issues credit with reference to the Cook Unit, and in return workers and consumers employ capital. 

 an agreement that places assets to be used by the Guarantee Society
 under nominal custody.
 Before this time when agreement is made and a Custodian formed the assets exist in a fragmented state often with misaligned interests...think of this state as 'matter unorganized.' We're going to organize it...align the interests in the same direction. The Custodian enforces an agreement and just kind of 'watches until all obey.' His Steward, the Manager/Service Provider/Bishop's Agent manages the process on a daily basis, making sure to keep title and transaction registries in order. 

The Asset Creators as it were utilize the proceeds of revenue-stream investors to acquire more assets. Farmers and consumers might see fit to expand farming infrastructure by forming an asset chain with the proceeds. Maybe they throw more farmland into the works, warehouses, processing facilities, a refinery, an electrical generation facility etc.
