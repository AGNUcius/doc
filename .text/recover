reKover.sf.net >>reKover is a free tool for data recovery, can recover lost data, data from damaged disk and lost partitions.

Alter.org.ua/en/soft/win/bb_recover >>Bad Block Copy for Windows    Copies file ignoring Bad Blocks.  If target file doesn't exists, instead of unread blocks ZEROs are written.  If target file exists, its blocks, coresponding to Bad Blocks in source are not touched.  Thus, if you have some copies of the same file with Bad Blocks in different places, it is possible to completly restore the original file.

VanHeusden.com/recoverdm >>This program will help you recover disks with bad sectors. You can recover files as well complete devices.  In case if finds sectors which simply cannot be recoverd, it writes an empty sector to the outputfile and continues.  If you're recovering a CD or a DVD and the program cannot read the sector in "normal mode", then the program will try to read the sector in "RAW mode" (without error-checking etc.).  This toolkit also has a utility called 'mergebad': mergebad merges multiple images into one. This can be usefull when you have, for example, multiple CD's with the same data which are all damaged. In such case, you can then first use recoverdm to retrieve the data from the damaged CD's into image-files and then combine them into one image with mergebad.

e2salvage.sf.net >>e2salvage is a utility which tries to do in-place data recovery a from damaged ext2 filesystems. Unlike e2fsck, it does not look for the data at particular places and it don't tend to believe the data it finds; thus it can handle much more damaged filesystem.

www.CGSecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec >>PhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from Hard Disks and CDRom and lost pictures (thus, its 'Photo Recovery' name) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the filesystem and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's filesystem has been severely damaged or re-formatted.

ReaR.sf.net >>Relax and Recover (abbreviated ReaR) is a highly modular disaster recovery framework for GNU/Linux based systems, but can be easily extended to other UNIX alike systems. The disaster recovery information (and maybe the backups) can be stored on the network, USB devices and DVD/CD-R. The result is a bootable rescue system that can be booted via PXE, DVD/CD and USB media.

mkCDrec.sf.net >>mkCDrec makes a bootable (El Torito) disaster recovery image (CDrec.iso), including backups of the linux system to the same CD-ROM (or CD-RW) if space permits, or to a multi-volume CD-ROM set. Otherwise, the backups can be stored on another local disk, NFS disk or (remote) tape.

MondoRescue.org >>Mondo Rescue is a GPL disaster recovery solution. It supports Linux (i386, x86_64, ia64) and FreeBSD (i386). It's packaged for multiple distributions (RedHat, RHEL, SuSE, SLES, Mandriva, Debian, Gentoo).

CrashRecovery.org >>Crash Recovery for Linux sounds a bit superfluous. Linux is regarded as one of todays most stable Operating Systems. In the case of some hardware failure like a broken disk it can however be handy.

CGSecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk >>TestDisk is a powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software, certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting your Partition Table). Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy.

Foremost.sf.net >>Foremost is a console program to recover files based on their headers, footers, and internal data structures. This process is commonly referred to as data carving. Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more reliable and faster recovery.

Channel16.sf.net >>Channel 16 is a graphical tool for recovering accidentally deleted files in ext2 filesystem. The application allows users to peer data blocks interactively for finding the right file and save them. In the future release, a search and rescue operation will be provided. It permits users to input the exact content of the lost file and automatically reports all the deleted inodes with matching results.

GNU.org/software/ddrescue >>GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue data in case of read errors.
