QuietHDD.GoogleCode.com >>quietHDD modifies the APM and AAM settings of Harddrives on startup, suspend, hibernate and tries to reduce noise The APM/AAM settings of an hard disk are lost on every wakeup event from suspend or hibernate. With quietHDD you can choose your own values for those settings and let them set again on every system startup, on every wakeup event from suspend or hibernate. The main advantage of quietHDD is the small size, it does not consumes any unnecessary CPU power and it designed to be simple, small and effective. You may even disable it's tray icon if you want to. quietHDD is loosely inspired by hdparm for Windows.

HardDriveEraser.org >>Hard Drive Eraser is free Windows application that permanently erase the data on whole volumes (hard drives). It does so by filling the magnetic surface multiple time with a useless binary data. It is a known fact that it is impossible to permanently destroy data just by formatting hard drive. It doesn't matter if you use Windows formatting or pay for a commerical disk formatting program. It wont work. In it's essence formatting drive is same as deleting files in Windows and than removing them from Recycle Bin. Just a small bits of information (links to files) are removed but the files still reside on hard drive and it is very easy to recover them using either commercial solution or one of applications for data recovery. That's why you may want to use Hard Drive Eraser, to shred the drive partition beyond any possible recovery.

Beyond simply deleting files, BleachBit includes advanced features such as shredding files to prevent recovery, wiping free disk space to hide traces of files deleted by other applications, and vacuuming Firefox to make it faster. Better than free, BleachBit is open source.

DiscUtils.CodePlex.com >>DiscUtils is a .NET library to read and write ISO files and Virtual Machine disk files (VHD, VDI, XVA, VMDK, etc). DiscUtils is developed in C# with no native code (or P/Invoke).  Implementation of the ISO, UDF, FAT and NTFS file systems is now fairly stable. VHD, XVA, VMDK and VDI disk formats are implemented, as well as read/write Registry support. The library also includes a simple iSCSI initiator, for accessing disks via iSCSI and an NFS client implementation.

Chiark.GreenEnd.org.uk/~sgtatham/agedu >>agedu is a program which does this. It does basically the same sort of disk scan as du, but it also records the last-access times of everything it scans. Then it builds an index that lets it efficiently generate reports giving a summary of the results for each subdirectory, and then it produces those reports on demand.

XCruiser.sf.net >>XCruiser, formerly known as XCruise, is a filesystem visualization utility.  It constructs a virtually 3-D formed universe from a directory tree and allows you to "cruise" within a visualized filesystem.  The original idea came to me when I was a university student.  I heard that tree-like filesystems are not necessarily best for us since we often remember the location of objects with spatial hints.  I was inspired by this idea and developed XCruiser.  I wish that someone create more user-friendly interfaces based on this program.

gt5.sf.net >>gt5 - a diff-capable 'du-browser'    Years ago, I was proud to own an 80MHz, 16MB RAM PC with a huge 512MB harddisk. But even on this incredibly huge harddisk, my diskspace seemed to disappear over time. So I wrote a little tool to find out where all my diskspace had gone: I called it gettree, as it showed all files in a directory and also calculated the size of subtrees. Over the years, the OS I used changed, but the problem stayed. Using Linux, there are some tools to deal with it, but I couldn't find anything that was clearly laid out, intuitive to browse, and doesn't need X-Windows.

GdMap.sf.net >>Welcome to the homepage of GdMap. GdMap is a tool which allows to visualize disk space. Ever wondered why your hard disk is full or what directory and files take up most of the space? With GdMap these questions can be answered quickly. To display directory structures cushion treemaps are used which visualize a complete folder or even the whole hard drive with one picture.
