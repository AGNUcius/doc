An Operating System should attempt to minimize overall resource usage by maximizing the effectiveness of physical source utilization per process.  This is traditionally accomplished by carefully allocating and scheduling the Material Means of production on a per-process basis according to the preceived 'needs' of that process and to generally inhibit process 'starvation' by weighting allocation and scheduling decisions against current holdings.

LoseThos.com >>If you have an x86_64 PC machine such as a Core_i7, a Core_2_Duo, a Pentium_D... nothing worse than a Pentium_4_Extreme_Edition, then enjoy the clean, 64-bit, programming environment of LoseThos.  In addition to having 64-bit registers, there are eight additional general purpose registers in 64-bit mode!  LoseThos is the ultimate in clean because all tasks on all cores can access all RAM memory at all times with no banking, protections or segmentation.  Essentially, there are no virtual addresses, just physical because PAGING IS NOT USED and pointers are 64-bit, able to access, directly, all of the 12 Gig RAM physical memory on my machine, at all times from all tasks on all cores.  LoseThos is like nothing else -- I wrote all of it, entirely from scratch, including the compiler/assembler.  It is the ultimate in clean and simple.

HelenOS.org >>Rather sooner than later, HelenOS will become a complete and usable modern operating system, offering room for experimenting and research. HelenOS uses its own microkernel written from scratch and supports SMP, multitasking and multithreading on both 32-bit and 64-bit, little-endian and big-endian processor architectures, among which are AMD64/EM64T (x86-64), ARM, IA-32, IA-64 (Itanium), 32-bit MIPS, 32-bit PowerPC and SPARC V9. Thanks to the relatively high number of supported architectures and suitable design, HelenOS is very portable. On top of the microkernel, HelenOS provides services such as file systems, networking, device drivers and user interface. Most of these services are composed of multiple independent server processes, which makes HelenOS one of the most modular operating systems.

Clonezilla.org >>You're probably familiar with the popular proprietary commercial package Norton Ghost.  Now there is an OpenSource clone system (OCS) solution called Clonezilla with unicasting and multicasting! With DRBL and network boot enabled client computers, the only thing you have to prepare is a Clonezilla server. You do not even have to prepare a bootable CD or floppy with Partition Image for every client computer.  Clonezilla, based on DRBL, Partition Image, ntfsclone, and udpcast, allows you can massively clone many (40 plus!) computers simultaneously. Unlike G4U (Ghost for Unix) or G4L (Ghost for Linux), Clonezilla saves and restores only used blocks in the harddisk. This increases the clone effiency. At the NCHC's Classroom C, Clonezilla was used to clone 41 computers simultaneously. It took about 50 minutes to clone a 5.6 GBytes system image to all 41 computers via unicasting and only about 10 minutes via multicasting!
