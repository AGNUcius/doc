The most important is apbuild, which is a drop-in build environment which creates binaries that work on older Linux distros by controlling glibc symbol versions, dependency scoping and correcting common distro portability mistakes.  It includes relaytool which can be used to convert required dependencies into optional ones by automatically building dlopen/dlsym thunks.

Packer.sf.net >>Packages are a great convenience for gurus and new users alike.  Thus, users may be less inclined to use software that is not packaged.  This is unfortunate for GNU/Linux software developers since packaging software is a huge pain, especially given the huge variety of packaging formats.  Packer helps to automate this process.  Using a text-based wizard, packer can collect all the information regarding a program needed to create a package.  Then, a simple command is all it takes to create a debian directory (used to build debian packages), RPM SPEC files (for Mandriva, SuSE, and Fedora/Red Hat), and autopackages spec files (autopackage is a system for creating distribution-neutral installers with dependency handling).  These files are of a similar quality to hand-crafted ones. Packer can also automatically build the packages themselves if requested.
