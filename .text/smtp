Obtuse.com/smtpd.html >>This is the Obtuse smtpd/smtpfwdd SMTP store and forward proxy. It can be used to pass SMTP mail across a dual-homed bastion host (such as in a firewall) with minimal danger.  It can also be used if you simply don't want your big complicated mail agent (such as sendmail) establishing direct contact with the outside world.
