AGNU is "Lord AGNUcius".

The word 'Lord' in Old English is "hlaf weard" which translates literally to "loaf warden" or "bread guard".  Bread is a vital source.  Lord also means "owner".  In these senses I use the title to indicate my desire to guard bread from capitalist profiteers by using regular property ownership and the GNU General Public Law to create true Source Freedom.

'AGNUcius' is AG as in "agriculture" and NU as in "nuit" or "nut" - being the primordial creative force of "nat"ure and also has the tone of "new" as in "fresh harvest" ~ the regenerative refreshing fire of life itself - whether as the reincarnation/resurrection of the SUN through it's daily and yearly cycles, or as the biological perpetuation of genetics for physical salvation and eternal life.  The word may also be divided as "A" "GNU" - with "cius" meaning "a follower of" just as Saint IGNUcius before me.
