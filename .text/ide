CodeMirror.net >>CodeMirror is a JavaScript library that can be used to create a relatively pleasant editor interface for code-like content - computer programs, HTML markup, and similar. If a mode has been written for the language you are editing, the code will be coloured, and the editor will optionally help you with indentation.

Cloud9IDE.com >>Cloud9 IDE is aiming to be the IDE for Javascript developers. We have all experienced the Eclipse variants and other Java or C++ IDE's for which webdevelopment and javascript was an afterthought. Extending these applications or customizing them to our needs was done in either Java or C++ and generally very difficult. We are developing applications in javascript to run online for a purpose, why shouldn't you do your application development online too?

wxDsgn.sf.net >>wxDev-C++ is an extension of Dev-C++ by Colin Laplace et. al. This program helps you to create dialogs and frames for wxWidgets visually using a form designer. With all the wonderful features of Dev-C++, wxDev-C++ is still being actively developed. The main aim of this project is to provide the wxWidgets community with a free, open-source, commercial-grade IDE/RAD tool for development with wxWidgets.

WideStudio.org >>WideStudio is an open source, Integrated Development Environment for desktop applications purely made in Japan. This enables you to develop GUI applications that can run on Windows95/98/Me/NT/2000/Xp/Vista, WindowsCE, Linux, FreeBSD, SOLARIS, MacOSX(w/X11), BTRON, T-Engine, mu-CLinux(wo/X11) in various programming languages such as C/C++, Java, Perl, Ruby, Python,Objective Caml    Since an application is build on MWT(Multi-Platform Widget Toolkit) which runs on multiple platforms, WideStudio applications are all source compatible between these platforms. If you developped an application in C/C++ language, you only need to re-compile the source code to run on a different platform in as native code.

LittleWizard.sf.net >>Little Wizard is a development environment for children. It is intended to be used by primary school children to learn about the main elements of real computer languages. Using only the mouse, children can explore programming concepts such as variables, expressions, loops, conditions, and logical blocks. Every element of the language is represented by an intuitive icon, making it easy to learn.

www.SRCF.UCAM.org/~dmi1000/roboc >>Roboc is designed as a teaching language, so it doesn't require any previous programming experience, and is suitable for short courses (from two hours to two weeks). Relatively young programmers (14-17 years) should find it OK. It has been developed in conjunction with programming classes for such students, and has evolved based on the issues which were observed during teaching. To keep things simple we added only those language features which turned out to be necessary (for example, and was added to conditions because deeply nested if statements caused difficulty for some students).
