==Intro
Git-SCM.com >>The fast version control system

Kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs

sunoano.name/ws/public_xhtml/scm.html

www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic >>Git is a version control Swiss army knife. A reliable versatile multipurpose revision control tool whose extraordinary flexibility makes it tricky to learn, let alone master.

WikiBooks.org/wiki/Source_Control_Management_With_Git

WhyGitIsBetterThanX.com >>This site is here because I seem to be spending a lot of time lately defending Gitsters against charges of fanboyism, bandwagonism and koolaid-thirst. So, here is why people are switching to Git from X, and why you should too.

==Tools
MSYSGit.GoogleCode.com >>Historically, Git on Windows was only officially supported using Cygwin. To help make a native Windows version, this project was started, based on the fork.

TortoiseGit.GoogleCode.com >>It is porting TortoiseSVN to TortoiseGit The latest release 0.9.1.0 This release can complete regular task, such commit, show log, diff two version, create branch and tag, Create patch and so on.
