Similar to how the GNU GPL uses Copyright to solve the problems of Copyright, we can use Property rights to solve the problems of Property rights.

Copyleft seems hypocritical because it *requires* Copyright to enforce it's solution to power concentration within the virtual (sacred or spiritual) world.

PropertyLeft is a analogous approach that will use Property rights to enforce a solution to power in the physical (profane or bodily) realm.

So the first step is to allow ourselves the notion that we can co-own Physical Sources such as Farms and Factories in a 'moral' or 'righteous' manner.

Then we must write the contract that we will choose to apply to such property for the purpose of ensuring Freedom for all of it's Users (Consumers).

Owners of "Intellectual Property" *choose* to tie their own hands - and the hands of anyone else building upon those resources - when the *choose* to apply the GNU GPL to their 'property'.

We, as co-owners of real, meatspace property can also *choose* to tie our hands - and the hands of anyone building upon that property - through a "Terms of Operation" that treats Price above Cost as a Payer's investment.

This will allow us to grow while keeping us from 'accidentally' overaccumulating wealth and power into the hands of the few that begin the operation.

The most fundamental problem with these entities is that they do not use property rights to eliminate the exchange of goods.

What I mean is easier to understand using an extremely simplified example:

The owner of a nut tree must pay all the Costs of production, including any Wages if he doesn't do all of the work himself.

But he cannot pay Profit because he does not 'buy' the nuts at the end of the season - they are *already* his property.

When this model is scaled through co-ownership - when a group of Consumers purchase a grove of nut trees with the understanding that they *own* the output of those trees in an amount directly related to the % of ownership they have in the orchard, then Price == Cost and Profit == 0.

But one more detail that must be addressed is the case where the Consumer accidentally owns more of the orchard (Physical Sources) than they need to satisfy their own needs.

In that case we (the group of co-owning consumers) should use "the market" to sell that excess to other consumers that do not yet have sufficient ownership in the orchard (for if they did, they would not need to buy nuts) but under a strict condition that any amount we charge over the real Cost incurred for that production must be treated as an Investment from the consumer who paid it.  This perpetuates the elimination of exchange.

This arrangement will outperform the "Free Market" because the investors are the consumers and expect only Product in return, and so these organizations can saely allow Price to reach Cost and are also not threatened by automation or robotics or abundance in general.

When a group of users organize and purchase the physical hardware needed to host a Cloud, they receive that service "at cost".  The price they pay is exactly the costs of operation.

But when that ownership is held by any other group, the owners will try to keep price *above* cost, for that is the very definition of profit.

Progress is failure?

This is only true because we are fooled into believing production is for *Profit*, while somehow forgetting the real purpose of production is *Product*.

This is enhanced by our faulty conclusion that the *Workers* should be the OWNers of the Means of Production.

But if *Consumers* of such products were to organize to buy or build and therefore OWN such a plant, they would be 'safe' from progress and automation since they do not need to keep Price above Cost, nor do they need to pretend employment is a need instead of seeing it as a hurdle on our road to success.

Supporters of the so-called "Free Market" claim all our troubles would be over if we could just stop the governments from handing favors to big business.

But producers choose to limit production and destroy reserves *on their own* because they want to keep price above cost.

The examples of this are many, but here is a video of hundreds of Belgian farmers dumping milk in an attempt to reduce the supply: http://YouTube.com/watch?v=pDAjMcDWDZ0

If the workers were the owners, the results would be the same.

We are fundamentally confused about the purpose of business.

We should be producing for *product* (use value), but are instead producing for *profit* (exchange value) which cannot abide abundance.

What will we ever do to solve this paradox?

I'm glad you bring up the issue of Profit.  The connection to Property ownership is not clear.

Profit can be thought of as the inverse to Consumer Property.

When a Consumer owns the Means of Production (say an Olive Tree), he then receives the Product (Olives in this case) exactly "at cost".  He can't pay Profit, for who would he pay it to?

Production is kindof "short-circuited" under the special condition of Source-Owner == Object-Consumer.

When the Owner of the Olive Tree eats a fruit for himself, he didn't avoid paying any Costs, but what he does avoid paying is Profit.

He can't pay Profit, because that occurs at the point-of-sale, but since he already owns the Product (Olives) as a side-effect of his OWNing the Sources (Olive Trees), the last transaction (buying Olives) doesn't ever occur.

Yes.  My solution to the 2nd problem is to write a "Terms of Operation" which we can use to begin new, special organizations that choose to abide and enforce (over their own Property) the rule that "Profit is to be treated as an Investment from the Consumer who Paid it.".

By doing this, the community is still able to grow (using that difference between Price and Cost), but the Ownership of that growth is automatically distributed to the person who was willing to pay for it.

The solution to the first problem is implicitly contained within the implementation of the rule, since any corporation choosing to use these "Terms of Operation" will have no reason to maximize Profits other than to speed the growth of that local community.

Furthermore, with regards to problem #1, Profits will naturally taper toward zero since a side-effect of Consumers gaining Property ownership is that they no longer pay Profit - it becomes undefined.

Yes, this is true and somewhat good in that we, as Commoners, will need to "grow" our holdings to replace the current system.  It's not that we need more total production on the Earth nearly as much as the Property ownership of those Means must be 'corrected' so they are held by the very humans for which that production is supposedly occuring (the Consumers).

But treating Profit as we do now causes growth to be concentrated into the hands of the current owners instead of becoming the Property of those who paid for it.



Apr-16-2010:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_%28accounting%29 says:
"'In accounting, profit is the *difference* between price and the costs of bringing to market whatever it is that is accounted as an enterprise (whether by harvest, extraction, manufacture, or purchase) in terms of the component costs of delivered goods and/or services and any operating or other expenses.'" (emphasis added)

And http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_%28economics%29 says:
"'In neoclassical economics, economic profit, or profit, is the *difference* between a firm's total revenue and its opportunity costs.'" (emphasis added)

So "Owner_Profit = Consumer_Price - Owner_Costs"

Profit, in itself, is neither good nor bad, but is simply an 'indicator' or a 'measure' of dependence.  It can be used for good by helping those who paid it to gain their own freedom, or it can be used for bad (as the Capitalist ignorantly do) to reward those who already have too much.

I agree there seems to be similarities, but so much of the jargon and complexities of high-finance and regulations are beyond my understanding so I'm still not fully sure how his plan works.

But one thing I did notice a videos or article of his (can't seem to find which it was now) was the idea that early payments should become equity.

This appears to be close to my observation that Profit (which can be thought of as a sort of "early payment") should be used to purchase Means of Production for that Payer - so he gains 'equity'.

Fabio, thanks for the kind words and for trying to merge this with your own understandings.

But notice you write "... which invest in the *farmer's* business ...".

It is difficult to imagine Consumers having real Ownership without mentioning the Workers.

There is a large psychological hurdle constructed by a long history of thinking those who have the skills needed to operate the Means of Production must be the Owners.

It seems to conjure images of a class of NON-Owning_Workers fending for themselves while the class of Owning_Consumers roll around, pushing buttons from a couch.

This is an unfortunate and inaccurate depiction of what I propose.  We *all* are Consumers of at least *some* things.  It is impossible for any human to continue living unless he consumes the output of a certain subset of living organisms.

We actually *do* want protect the Worker, but instead of protecting his supposed 'need' to work, we must protect his real need to Consume.

This allows us to _safely_ drive Costs (even Wages) as low as possible, and to _safely_ automate and even eliminate employment when possible without crisis.

The traditional approach of increasing Worker Wages is like pushing a rope.

Consumers with 'sufficient' Ownership in the Means of Production (for example, owning a % of a milk-cow) do not pay Profit - in fact they don't even buy the milk, for they already own the Product as a sort of 'side-effect' of their ownership in the Means {by the way, I use the word 'Sources' and 'Means' interchangeably}.

Consumers with 'insufficient' Source Ownership are 'vulnerable' to those current Owners, and so will likely agree to pay Profit {by the way, I use the word 'Profit' and the phrase "Price above Cost" interchangeably}.

Observe that, even current owners do not need any more Source Ownership, the "external consumer" is still going to pay more than it really Cost to supply the Product (milk for example).

So we might be tempted to avoid charging Profit.  We might think charging a Price that is exactly and only the Costs of that *PREVIOUS* round of production would be the "right thing" to do.

But if we do that, then the "external consumer" who paid

Profit only occurs when Consumers do not own the Means of Production.

When groups of Consumers organize to purchase and therefore OWN farms and factories, then Profit can safely reach zero, since the payment those Consumers expect is the *Product* itself.

So Profit is an inverse measure of competition.  Or another way is to say Profit measures Consumer dependence upon the current Owners.

We should not be trying to perpetuate Profit by propping-up Prices, but should instead treat that overpayment as an Investment from the Consumer who Paid it.

Treating Profit as Payer Investment is a "negative feedback loop" that allows growth while simultaneously 'distributing' that growth to those that are willing to pay for it.

Notice this is also an auto-leveling system that avoids the now systemic problem of over-accumulation that Capitalism suffers.

Within such an investment plan, growth "tapers off" as demand is filled (as Consumers gain ownership in the Means of Production) and does not promote overconsumption caused when we strive to perpetuate Profit.

'Normal' investment techniques cannot withstand perfect competition because typical investors are expecting to be paid the difference between Price and Cost which requires Consumers NOT have ownership in the Means of Production, for under conditions of Consumer Ownership, Price == Cost and Profit == 0!

> Please refer to chapter 2 of George's book for the definitions of land, rent, labor, wage, capital, interest, wealth, and profit. I agree with his book and his theory and he has already defined these terms. I was under the impression that you vead and understood his book.

Sorry, but his analysis is imperfect.

Specifically with regards to profit he quotes: "as Adam Smith shows, the high profits of retail storekeepers are in large part wages, being the recompense of their labor and not of their capital"

But this is incorrect.  Profit does NOT come from the exertion of Workers, but from Consumer dependence brought about by the Consumers' lack of ownership in Physical Sources (including lack of ownership in Land).

This is a deep misunderstanding that almost all economists have fallen for.

I will prove it is incorrect, and prove that my explanation is true in a future email.


> We do not need to purchase land under George's proposal.

I know many people despise the idea of ownership, but property  *does* have some good qualities - we only need to discover how to "cut out" the bad parts and prohibit them through a contract or "Terms of Operation" that we can apply to the property (including Land) that we purchase toward our righteous goals.


> Nobody can own land, only use it.

Why claim something so obviously incorrect?

You may *wish* that Land could not be owned, but certainly there are owners of Land already.

These current owners are doing the wrong thing with that property, but that doesn't mean we must do the wrong things.

We *can* purchase and own Land - and at that point we can finally have a say in how it is treated.


> brainwashing that makes us believe we can purchase and own land.

First you say purchasing land is impossible...

> This is the problem with the current system. Private land ownership.

Then you say purchasing land is the only problem...

Which is it?


> If we base a new system off of private land ownership, we get nowhere.

That is only true if were not going to add certain constraints (private-property holders can always add arbitrary conditions to the use of that property) to inhibit bad behavior.

The most important of these constraints is that Profit must be treated as an Investment from the Consumer who Paid it.  By doing this, we create a system that allows everyone who participates to eventually gain the ownership they need to also have "fair access" just as you hope for though maybe in a way that for now seems too perverted to consider.


> To receive fair and just compensation for labor, weather this comes in the form of wage or wealth, we need fair and just access to land.

The Capitalist are *already* using Land ownership against us, so let's HACK THE SYSTEM by utilizing that same technique (property ownership in Land) *against* the Capitalists in a Jujitsu sort of manner.

If we don't have property ownership in Land, we will never have any voice whatsoever, even while the scum that run our planet are using property ownership in Land to suppress freedom and abundance in the name of profit through scarcity.

> Land requires rent.

Sometimes, yes.  But that is only true when the occupier is not the owner.

When a person is the actual owner of the area they occupy, then Rent == 0.

When you own a parcel of land and a house on it, you pay only 'real' costs of: Initial purchase, maintenance (wear parts, oil, etc.), and operation (labor, fuel, etc.).

If this is not true, then tell me who would receive the Rent under that condition.


> Labor requires wage.
I agree.


> Capital requires interest.

Sometimes, yes.  But that is only true when the operator is not the owner.

When a person is the actual owner of the machine they operate, then interest on that machine == 0.

When you own a tiller, you pay only 'real' costs of: Initial purchase, maintenance (wear parts, oil, etc.), and operation (labor, fuel, etc.).

If this isn't true, then tell me who would receive the Interest under that condition.


> Wealth - rent - wage - interest = profit
> After wealth has paid back the land, labor and capital the excess is what is termed "profit", or progress.

The definition of 'Profit' you are using may be popular, but it is not what I am talking about.

I'm talking about the difference between the Costs an *OWNER* of the "Means of Production" must pay for production, and the final Price a *CONSUMER* must pay to receive that product.


Let's consider the case of a simple business selling lemonade.

The way I frame the situation is:

Before production has even begun, the business OWNER will pay the Costs to begin.

 [Structured in the rent/wage/interest form you are accustomed]:
COST#1: He will buy or rent or go into debt for some Land.
COST#2: He will pay wages to a worker or spend his own time doing that labor.
COST#3: He will buy or rent or go into debt for some Tools.

Once production is underway, the OWNER may begin selling some Product.

When he sells the Product, he will try to get Consumers to pay more for the finished Product than it *really* Cost to make that Product.

I am not saying this is 'good' or 'bad', I am just stating the way I understand things, and asking if this sounds reasonable, and whether it seems valuable for discussion.

So my equation looks like:

Profit = Consumer_Price - Owner_Costs


I am confused about the equation {Wealth - rent - wage - interest = profit} because I don't understand where Consumer_Price fits.

Hello All,

This thinking can also be used to reconsider how Profit effects 'allocation', and who should benefit from that growth.

Organizations grow when they can sell a good or service for a Price more than it really Cost to produce.  That is Profit, of course.

So Profit is important for growth, but the *allocation* of that growth (who, in the end, should (ideally) be the *owner* of any investments made with that Profit) is severely lopsided toward rewarding those that are already invested, while leaving the late-arriving payer without any allocation at all.

This causes power centralization through property over-accumulation.


We have somehow forgotten or disregard the importance of the Consumer who *paid* for that growth (each time they Price above Cost).


1.) Treating profit as a 'reward' for the current owners is a "Positive Feedback Loop" http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback that destabilizes Capitalistic organizations as they grow because those who already have some 'allocation' (the current owners) tend to see no reason to avoid keeping control of that grow for themselves - and so over-allocate even more to themselves.

2.) Treating profit as an investment from the Consumer who paid it is a "Negative Feedback Loop" http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback that continuously spreads Capital allocation to those who are willing to pay (work) for it and so spreads control over any such entity in a self-leveling manner.


We should keep these extremes in mind as we attempt to restructure production.
