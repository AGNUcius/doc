The Intra-Owner Trade Agreement (IOTA) is a 

 Deposit-Based, *Insuring* currency representing some quantity and quality of a Product and backed by the Means of Production and Promises to Labor from Workers.


1.) Commitments of Sources: These is the physical assets
   needed to produce food and shelter for those Villagers.

- Commitments of Skills: These are the various kinds
   of goals that need to be accomplished within the Village.

The IOTA is invalid Unless both of those conditions are met.

--

The IOTA enforces the following constraints on Trade:

- Product is Investor's Return: The Product is not sold*,
   because each Villager already owns the exact** amount
   of Product from their ownership in Sources.
* Surplus can be sold to those who own insufficient Sources.
** Predictions are never exact, but we can 'hover' nearby.
  Most Villagers will 'overcommit' as Insurance against low
  production seasons.


- Profit is Payer Investment: When Surplus is sold to non-
   owners, the Profit must be treated as an Investment from
   that Payer - so that latecomers gain as much control as
   they are willing to Pay, and ultimately Work for.



claim over the Sources and Skills
required for production.

Debt as a "promise to pay" means a
worker can promise apply his Skills
in the future for food and shelter today.

TRUST as the land, plants, tools, etc.
needed to host that production.

This currency represents 3 things:

0. A PRODUCT of some predicted type, quantity and quality.

1. Commitments of the SOURCES such as land, mineral/water rights,
buildings, tools, etc. required for production.  This co-owned
property must be constrained by legally binding social contract.  See
the GNU General Public Law and PropertyLeft for attempts.

2. Commitments of all the SKILLS required for production.


For example:
0. One dozen grade A, medium chicken eggs every week.

1. Co-ownership in land and tools etc. of a chicken farm and to grow their feed.

2. Commitments from all the people required to make it happen.

THIS TITLE IS A PREDICTION OF PERFORMANCE
#0 IS INSURED ONLY IF #1 AND #2 ARE SECURED
