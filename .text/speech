GNU.org/software/gnuspeech >>Gnuspeech is an extensible, text-to-speech package, based on real-time, articulatory, speech-synthesis-by-rules. That is, it converts text strings into phonetic descriptions, aided by a pronouncing dictionary, letter-to-sound rules, rhythm and intonation models; transforms the phonetic descriptions into parameters for a low-level articulatory synthesiser; and uses these to drive an articulatory model of the human vocal tract producing an output suitable for the normal sound output devices used by GNU/Linux.

Cgstmad.sf.net >>Cgstmad is an experimental articulatory speech synthesizer that uses GnuSpeech's  tube model and articulation data. It's written in C++ and released under GNU GPL. Runs on Linux and possibly on other POSIX systems.
