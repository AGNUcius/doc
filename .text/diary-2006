President Bush seized this unprecedented power on the very same day that he signed the equally odious Military Commissions Act of 2006. In a sense, the two laws complement one another. One allows for torture and detention abroad, while the other seeks to enforce acquiescence at home, preparing to order the military onto the streets of America. Remember, the term for putting an area under military law enforcement control is precise; the term is "martial law."

"'A major drug company is blocking access to a medicine that is cheaply and effectively saving thousands of people from going blind because it wants to launch a more expensive product on the market.

Ophthalmologists around the world, on their own initiative, are injecting tiny quantities of a colon cancer drug called Avastin into the eyes of patients with wet macular degeneration, a common condition of older age that can lead to severely impaired eyesight and blindness. They report remarkable success at very low cost because one phial can be split and used for dozens of patients.

But Genentech [ gene.com ] , the company that invented Avastin, does not want it used in this way.

Instead it is applying to license a fragment of Avastin, called Lucentis, which is packaged in the tiny quantities suitable for eyes at a higher cost. Speculation in the US suggests it could cost £1,000 per dose instead of less than £10.'"

"'
Very nice pondering.  I especially like the "responsibility deficit" term.

I agree with your words, yet I continue to purchase bread because we don't yet have a competetive alternative.

You say "the value of a resource is completely dependent on demand", but sometimes we forget that we have our own demands - even if we were to only consider the most bare of organic needs and disregard so-called wants.

These basic demands must be met or we cannot perpetuate our genes, but we are in an economic system that allows owners to take a portion of the value (labor) we peacefully exchange.  Corporate shareholders call this 'profit', but the Koran, the Holy Bible, and many other texts refer to it as usury.  This terrible disease causes humans to 'externalize' costs, which turns an otherwise efficient economy inside-out, so that many goals that would make sense on an island (such as abundance) become 'bad' for business.

I'll stop for now.  Thanks again for the careful thoughts.

December 13, 2005
To: The Honorable Kay Bailey Hutchison

This letter is in response to S. 517, "the Weather Modification Research and Development Policy Authorization Act of 2005,"

  Because small scale weather modification (e.g., cloud seeding) may promote rain in one area to the detriment of another, weather modification could result in inter-state (including Indian Tribes) litigation or private citizen litigation against the modification programs.

  Small and large scale (e.g., hurricane) weather modification efforts could benefit the United States to the detriment of other countries (such as Canada or Mexico).

  Given global weather patterns, whether one country "owns" its weather so as to assert intra-border control with extra-border consequences, must be considered under present international conventions.

  In 1978, the United States became a party to an international treaty banning the use of weather modification for hostile purposes. While modification for peaceful purposes is allowed, whether well-intentioned programs could be considered "hostile" and perceived to violate this ban should be considered.
