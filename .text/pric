Price = Cost + Profit

Consumer Price = Owner Cost + Owner Profit
Owner Costs include Worker Wages.

1. An owner may set the price too high, but nobody is interested in that.

2. An owner may set the price in the window of "just right" to be able to pay all costs while making some profit.

3. An owner may choose to set the price as close to "at cost" as possible. This makes sense when the consumers of the Objects of that Source are also the collective owners of that Source.

3a. If all the store owners, and all of the consumers of those imported items that were being serviced by the example truck were the collective owners of that truck, then keeping the price as close to "at cost" as possible makes sense because it only reduces their costs for trucking.

4. Owners may set price to 0 and absorb the costs, but that is not sustainable.

* Owners may set any price, but are realistically constrained on the bottom by real costs and on the top by competing owners and consumer demand.

Real costs include any inescapable taxes incurred by the 'containing' government.
