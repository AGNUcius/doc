Aug-31-2013: Reconsidering the Intra-Owner Trade Agreement (IOTA)

Workers can easily produce the solutions to all their needs if they can commit to voluntarily specialize *before* production begins.

When the consumers of an output are the owners of the inputs, production can safely operate "at cost" while profit is undefined.

For example, when the eater of an orange is the owner of the land, water-rights, tools, trees, etc. needed to create oranges, then he must pay all the costs of production (including wages for work he does not do himself).

We can own all the land and tools and organisms used to produce of all our food, housing, cloth, soap, sanitation, health care, transportation, education, etc.

But it requires crowds can control sources and trade commitments of future labor.
