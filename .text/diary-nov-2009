Nov-25-2009: EcologyAndSociety.org >>The journal seeks papers that are novel, integrative and written in a way that is accessible to a wide audience that includes an array of disciplines from the natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities concerned with the relationship between society and the life-supporting ecosystems on which human wellbeing ultimately depends.  Content of the journal ranges from the applied to the theoretical.  In general, papers should cover topics relating to the ecological, political, and social foundations for sustainable social-ecological systems.  Specifically, the journal publishes articles that present research findings on the following issues: (a) the management, stewardship and sustainable use of ecological systems, resources and biological diversity at all levels, (b) the role natural systems play in social and political systems and conversely, the effect of social, economic and political institutions on ecological systems and services, and (c) the means by which we can develop and sustain desired ecological, social and political states.

And we share tools and tips to help you make a shareable world real in your life.  In a shareable world, things like clothing swaps, childcare coops, potlucks, carsharing, community gardening, and cohousing bring us together, make life more fun, and free up time and money for the important things in life.  When we share, not only is a better life possible, but so is a better world.

Nov-24-2009: Ideas: Text2Menu and COMMAND2Menu for both documentation and implementation from the same 'source' files.

Text2Menu could be used to generate the 'Star' menu for MiniMacs.
COMMAND2Menu could also be used in the 'Star' menu

COMMAND2Menu could be used to create a right-click "shell extension" in Windows exposing verbs to use against files.


Nov-24-2009: Thinking alot about funding and revenue models.
Here is the rough idea:
1.) Attract a large group of consumers who can afford to pre-pay for some product (raw milk for example).
2.) Treat those pre-payments as the investments of co-owners.
3.) Allow co-owners to sell any amount of their own product for any price, but require all profit be treated as an investment from that new payer.

Nov-18-2009: CollaborativeConsumption.com >>Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers are currently writing a book that focuses on a new, emerging economy they describe as 'Collaborative Consumption. This occurs when people collaborate together through organized sharing, bartering, trading, renting, swapping and collectives to get the same pleasures of ownership with reduced personal cost and burden, and lower environmental impact.

I have little hope for this book since profit is yet again treated as a owner reward instead of payer investment: "'Collaborative Consumption is a vision of the future where businesses are profitable in a way that is sustainable because they embrace the various intersections that connect the economy, the community and the environment.'" - Botsman

Subject: Artificial Scarcity and the Value of Crisis

http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_scarcity tells us "'... a state of complete abundance will crash any market economy.'"

What better to reverse abundance that to create a crisis - such as war or 


Labor Theory of Value

Wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility says "'In economics, the marginal utility of a good or of a service is the utility of the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase in that good or service, or of the specific use that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease. In other words, marginal utility is the utility of the marginal use — which, on the assumption of economic rationality, would be the least urgent use of the good or service, from the best feasible combination of actions in which its use is included.[1][2] Under the mainstream assumptions, the marginal utility of a good or service is the posited quantified change in utility obtained by increasing or by decreasing use of that good or service.

This concept grew out of attempts by economists to explain the determination of price. The term “marginal utility”, credited to the Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser by Alfred Marshall,[3] was a translation of Wieser's term “Grenznutzen” (border-use).[1][2]'"



The "Crisis of Value" is a misnomer for the 

 an error in logic caused when the origin and purpose of profit are misunderstood.

In simplified terms, 'profit' is the difference between price and cost: it is "Price Above Cost".  Wages are not profit; they are yet another cost.

It is common thinking to believe production cannot occur unless price is kept above cost - for who would invest without a return, and what could that return be besides profit?

Ah, but we forget or tend to minimize the importance of a situation where production *does* occur without profit - where price and cost are the same.


Profit is traditionally used to pay the investors.  It is their 'return'.  Why fund production otherwise?

The other (and originally only) reason for 
 is  instead of product.

We do not yet know how to organize consumers funding production for the sole purpose of product.

We instead resort to attracting investors that expect to be paid from the value called 'profit'.



Nov-18-2009: A GNU society will help each human control the sources of the objects he needs even when that actor does not posess the skills needed to 'operate' those physical sources.  This is the basis of "Payer Owned" production.

Nov-18-2009: Economic efficiency is partly a measure of utilization.  Land and tools should be under heavy 'load' to provide a much higher object-per-source ratio than Capitalism through scheduling that maximizes access while minimizing profit.
