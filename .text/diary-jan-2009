Dumping is only a problem for owners who intend to keep price above cost.  This is the traditional approach to Capitalistic production. But Capitalism is not the only way we might organize.

Profit seems to be necessary because that is what we traditionally promise as a 'return' for initial investments.

But there is another way, where the product is NOT sold after production, but is instead already owned by those intending to use it.

There is a special case of ownership where price above cost is not only unsought, but is strangely undefined!

When the initial investors (and therefore owners) of production are ALSO the very consumers of the output of that production (the product), then production is "at cost" as a sort of side-effect of that ownership.

I see that you have a plan to set the price of each product that comes from any organization choosing to operate in your special manner, and maybe there is some merit to that.

But I want to stress that you may be overlooking the self-balancing solution I describe as "treat price above cost as an investment from (he paid it) and for (he will be the owner of those new assets) the very consumer who made that overpayment toward more Physical Sources of Production".



> The only way for producers to make a profit, under the model

Profit is not a prerequisite to Production when the collective Consumers are the investors and full Owners of those Means of Production.

This is not to imply that each Consumer must necessarily Work in all those industries he would have Ownership in.

== For example:
If you and I and 998 other people decide we want organic, whole, raw milk, we could get together and buy a dairy.

We would each make an initial investment based upon how much we each intend (what we each forecast) that we will consume.

We would pool some of those initial investments to buy some land, water rights, living cattle, feed, tools, etc.

We would also need to pay some skilled workers to tend and milk those animals, and there are some recurring costs that we would each need to pay periodically.

That sounds like alot of paying, but it's easy to prove that a business organized in this way is cheaper for the Consumer when we consider a Capitalist dairy farmer must pay those exact same costs.

All costs must necessarily be "passed on" to the Consumer (the Consumer finally pays for all costs of production) for that farmer to remain in business, but what we somehow overlook is that the farmer is also intending to charge a price ABOVE that cost - so he can 'profit' from his "exchange value" based venture.

When the Product Consumers are the Physical Source Owners, then there is no reason to sell the product after it is made, for it is already in the hands of those intending to use it.

Each Consuming Owner would not 'buy' the milk after it was made, they would simply go to the storehouse and pickup what they already OWN. They each own the amount of product they need when they each own "just the right amount" of Physical Sources required for that production, and when they are willing to continue to pay the recurring costs of that production.

Sincerely,
Patrick

I approve of THAT murdering.  I'm not unwilling to fight.

We have been misled as to who the terrorists really are.

Terrorists hate freedom 'cause it's bad for the market.

The real terrorists are those that *play* Capitalism the best: the personhoods called Corporations: http://BlueGold-WorldWaterWars.com
