LDView.sf.net >>LDView is a real-time 3D viewer for displaying LDraw models using hardware-accellerated 3D graphics. It was written using OpenGL, so should be accellerated on any video card which provides full OpenGL 3D accelleration (so-called mini-drivers are not likely to work). It should also work on other video cards using OpenGL software rendering, albeit at a much slower speed. For information on LDraw, please visit www.ldraw.org, the centralized LDraw information site.

PIAVCA.org >>PIAVCA is the Platform Independent API for Virtual Characters and Avatars. The project aims to produce a unified character animation system that is usable across multiple platforms and that can be used as a basis for virtual character and animation research across a number of domains. Piavca is implemented using the Cal3d animation library and is able to integrate smoothly with a number of different graphics architectures. The major focus of PIAVCA is body animation, particularly based on motion capture data or hand animated motion data. PIAVCA contains a number of features that help with the manipulation of motion data. The most important being a single abstraction for all sources of motion data, whether they are data loaded from file, real time streams such as tracking data, procedural animation or manipulations of existing data. This allows for very flexible motion manipulation systems. PIAVCA has been released as open source software under the Mozilla Public licence at which point we will be keen to encourage academics researching virtual characters to use it.

Open5.sf.net >>The Open5 framework is an Open Source Initiative to support the fast prototyping of new applications with advanced 3D visualization techniques combined with innovative interaction techniques. Open5 relies on both OpenSG and OpenTracker technologies to provide an integrated solution with a powerful 3D scenegraph and support for tracking devices. Open5 proposes a flexible event loop management to fit any VR/MR/AR setup and to support multi-input configurations. This framework enables the usage of customized visualization devices such as Head Mounted Displays, Tiled display systems or traditional Desktop monitors. Thanks to flexible XML based configuration files, it enables customized prototyping and fast integration mechanisms with a complete separation of inputs, interaction and functionality.

VTK supports a wide variety of visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and volumetric methods; and advanced modeling techniques such as implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. Additionally, VTK has an extensive information visualization framework, has a suite of 3D interaction widgets, supports parallel processing, and integrates with various databases on GUI toolkits such as Qt and Tk. VTK is cross-platform and runs on Linux, Windows, Mac and Unix platforms.
