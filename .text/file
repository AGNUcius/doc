Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive.

These built-in types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more reliable and faster recovery.

Initially developed by Oracle, Btrfs is licensed under the GPL and open for contribution from anyone. Linux has a wealth of filesystems to choose from, but we are facing a number of challenges with scaling to the large storage subsystems that are becoming common in today's data centers. Filesystems need to scale in their ability to address and manage large storage, and also in their ability to detect, repair and tolerate errors in the data stored on disk.
