How To Boot From A USB Flash Drive

For starters this is still a new science and many people have had good luck with at least one of these methods and others have not. Note that flash drives are often also called thumb drives, keychain drives, pendrives, etc.

A FEW THINGS YOU NEED TO CONSIDER IN ADVANCE.

1. The PC has to support booting from a USB flash drive. There may be anywhere from 1-3 items to change in the BIOS to make this possible assuming your BIOS supports it. Some bios's may refer to your flash drive as a USB floppy or USB zip.
2. The USB flash drive must support booting from it in general.
3. The flash drive must contain the boot/system files.
4. The flash drive must have bootsector area. This is done with special utilities.
5. References to "A:" drive lines in the autoexec.bat and/or config.sys files you copy to the drive after you make it bootable may result in errors.
6. You "may" have to format your floppy disk first in WinXP before you create a bootdisk as XP may "not" like working later on with a disk formatted otherwise.
7. Included below is a bootable ISO of DOS 7.1 which may be used with some of these methods if you do not have a 1.44 drive.

"'Instructions - installing Parted Magic to a USB stick

Download the latest version of Parted Magic LiveUSB. You should have a file called
partedmagic-liveusb-1.X.zip, where 1.X is the current version. Unzip that file to
your USB stick and you can do this in Linux using the unzip command, or using
Winzip in Windows.

Then run syslinux, which will install the bootloader needed for Parted Magic to be
able to boot from the USB stick. Syslinux can be downloaded at
http://syslinux.zytor.com

or from here:

http://partedmagic.com/downloads/syslinux/syslinux.exe.zip

in Linux type:

syslinux /dev/sda1

if your USB drive is found at /dev/sda1.

in Windows type:

syslinux.exe E:

if your USB drive is found at E:

This should make your USB stick bootable.
