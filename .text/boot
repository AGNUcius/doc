netboot.me >>netboot.me is a service that allows you to boot nearly any operating system or utility on any computer with a wired internet connection - without having to know ahead of time what you'll want to boot.  Once you can netboot.me, you never need to update your boot disk again!  netboot.me works through the magic of netbooting.  There are a number of ways to boot a computer with netboot.me.  The simplest is to download a bootable image and burn it to a CD, USB memory stick, or floppy disk. Boot off it on any networked computer, and it will automatically fetch the latest boot options from netboot.me and let you choose from dozens of installation, recovery, testing, portable desktop and other tools.  You can also start netboot.me from any computer running gPXE, or from any netbootable computer with some simple tweaks to your DHCP server.

You can download these program from our site (available at Downloads section). Also, you can find a list of distributions and tools that can be booted with BKO here. Your small 56KB gpxe program can boot any of these options!

"'BOOTING FROM HARD DRIVE

Things needed:
A Lilo or GRUB boot loader installed and working.
The lastest Parted Magic iso.
A working Linux Distro.

First we'll open the iso file with these comands:

$ mkdir iso
$ mount -o loop /path/to/iso/partedmagic-livecd-1.X.iso iso
$ cd iso
$ ls

partedmagic isolinux

I have decided to boot from my windows drive that is mounted on /mnt/windows:

patrick@partedmagic:~/iso$ cp -a * /mnt/winows

I need to update my boot loader so it can find the bzImage and initrd files. My windows
drive is /dev/hda1.

For GRUB add this to menu.lst:

title partedmagic
root (hd0,0)
kernel /isolinux/bzImage root=/dev/ram0 initrd=initrd init=/linuxrc ramdisk_size=67000
initrd /isolinux/initrd

For lilo add this to lilo.conf:

image= /mnt/windows/isolinux/bzImage
label = partedmagic
initrd = /mnt/windows/isolinux/initrd
append = "init=/linuxrc"
root = /dev/ram0
ramdisk=67000

Be sure to run /sbin/lilo!

Now reboot the computer and select partedmagic from the boot menu. When the Parted Magic LiveCD/USB Extra Boot Options comes up select "Pick boot device".

Now type the name of the device to boot from in the box.

After hitting "OK" we will be returned to the main menu. Select "Done" and the system
will boot.

That's it!

UBCD4Win.net (non-Free) >>UBCD4Win is a bootable recovery CD that contains software used for repairing, restoring, or diagnosing almost any computer problem. Our goal is to be the most complete and easy to use free computer diagnostic tool. Almost all software included in UBCD4Win are freeware utilities for WindowsÂ®. Some of the tools inlcuded are "free for personal use" copies so users need to respect these licenses. A few of the tools included in UBCD4Win are paid for and licensed software owned by UBCD4win. On occasion we work with software companies/authors for permission to include their software in our download or have requested their software better support PE. Users can freely share copies of UBCD4Win with friends but selling UBCD4Win for a profit is not acceptable. We have worked hard for many years helping people for free with this project, others should not make money from our hard work. If you are a dialup user having a hard time downloading UBCD4Win, please visit our ordering page. UBCD4Win is based on Bart's PEÂ©. Bart's PEÂ© builds a WindowsÂ® "pre-install" environment CD, basically a simple WindowsÂ® XP booted from CD. UBCD4Win includes network support and allows you the ability to modify NTFS volumes, recover deleted files, create new NTFS volumes, scan hard drives for viruses, etc. Our download includes almost everything you need to repair your system problems. This project has been put together to be the ultimate recovery cd and not a replacement OS (Operating System). Please visit the "List of Tools" page for a complete list of what is included in the latest version of UBCD4Win.
