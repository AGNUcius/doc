Hoarding hlaf weards lock our lives closed.
But seeds for our future soon must be sown.

Usurist loaf wardens scarcify land, water, gene, tool.
Sources held ransom by pirates of life.

Freedom hating bread guards tax improvements for profit.
Manoralists of today sharecrop our vitae.


Enough!


In the land of software there's something afoot.
Sn. IGNUcius' law keeps knights beyond moat.

This puddle of freedom protects community.
Feudalists know why the GPL is bad for the economy.

These puddles become floods as artisans hack.
We create far too much.  The market is flat.

Free Sources are mutation of this autarchic stand.
Progress through abundance is the GNU plan.
