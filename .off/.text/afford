In Response To: home price (Miykal)

"Affordable Housing" is so common a cry.
But what makes that price _so_ crazy high?

When a bare lot alone is 5 years wages,
Where does the value go?  What *is* this speculation?

If you say "It goes to the investor that bought the land early.",
I say "What good does he do us? Why suffer this usury?"

Humans are animal, but much more than that;
Humans collaborate and sometimes make pacts.

These pacts in the past were fealty to Lord.
The etymology is "hlaf weard" - literally "loaf warden", "bread guard".

But when the guard is a hoarder (as our laws do reward),
And the pact with the vassal is to enforce bloody power;

Then the keeping of bread from the mouth of the worker
Is the employment we now mistakenly call securor.

Security is a dream as these barons make our land barren;
For it is in their best interest to stop all (but their own) production.

This externalization comes only through hoarding,
So let's choose to stop it by syndicating the Nash Equilibrium.

This can be done by purchasing as usual,
But then holding those resources in a way most peculiar.

This way is called 'Freedom' by those who enforce it.
They use Copyleft through Copyright until Gates can't ignore it.

This is the choice of the owner.  It is not coercion.
Abundance minimizes profit and protects worker action.

Let's do this more generally, maybe call it "Property Left".
Using property rights to control those who would speculate.
