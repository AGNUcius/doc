"'True Peppermint, (Mentha piperita): Perennial
Spearmint, (Mentha spicata var. crispi): Perennial

Native to Europe and Asia, the mint families' origins are rich with mythology, and their tasty leaves have been an important herb from the days of the Greeks and Romans. Notoriously vigorous, our mints will grow into spreading 2 foot plants. They thrive in a partly shady spot with plenty of moisture. Space plants 1 to 1 1/2 feet apart. Any good soil will suit mints, but avoid using fresh manure in planting. Sprigs of green leaves can be harvested from early spring until frost. Frequent cutting will keep mints looking and producing best, and encourage branching healthy plants. Since plants spread rapidly from underground roots, it's best to contain the mints' rapid growth. Surround plants with metal strips at least 10 inches deep, or sink bottomless cans into the soil and plant mint inside them. If you don't contain the plants, be prepared to dig up unwanted shoots regularly or they will spread through the garden; we like to grow mints in large containers to limit their growth. In late fall cut mint plants to the ground; overwintered plants will regrow happily in the spring. Cooking with Peppermint: There is not substitute for the flavor of fresh peppermint in making a restorative soothing tea or a cooling iced drink. Peppermint sprigs also make appetizing and attractive edible decorations and garnishes. Cooking with Spearmint: Spearmint flavor is delightful with most fruits, brings out the sweetness of melons and berries, and is traditional with spring lamb. Its sweet mild taste complements tiny new potatoes, peas, beans, and carrots. A world traveler, try its aromatic leaves in Greek, Middle Eastern, and Indian dishes.'" -- unknown
