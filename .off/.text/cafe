Some coffee growers in Nicaragua were saved from starvation through community supported agriculture after being laid off because of a world wide coffee glut.  Many blame the glut on Vietnam - who has suddenly become a new, large coffee producer.  I use the negative word 'blame' - yet they are not trying to do any bad thing.  The problem arises from a fundamental flaw in our economic model.


"'Generating $18 billion in annual sales, coffee is the world's second-largest legally traded commodity after oil. Each year the United States, the largest coffee importer, consumes about a fifth of the total. The bean is the most important agricultural export for dozens of Third World countries, including Mexico, the chief U.S. supplier.'" -- source unknown

"'# Coffee is the second-most traded commodity in the world economy, after oil.
# One coffee tree yields slightly less than 1 pound of coffee per year.
# For every pound of gourmet coffee sold, small-coffee farmers receive between 12¢ and 25¢.
# In Guatemala, 70 children out of every 1,000 die before age 5; 51 of those children will not live to reach their first birthdays.
# There is only 1 doctor for every 85,000 people in the Western Highlands of Guatemala.

"'old coffed beans have much lower germination rates.

It is advisable to pregerminate the seeds by soaking them in water for 24 hours then sowing in damp sand or wet/drained vermiculite.  Alternatively, you can place the seeds between moist coffee sacks, which should be watered twice a day and well drained.

Move the germinated seed to a friable loam soil with a high humus content.  Rotted manure, compost, sand should be used to produce a soil with a low pH and high nitrogen content.  A fertilizer appropriate for orchids can be used sparingly for the coffee plant to maintain mineral levels and a low pH (acidic).

The soil should remain well drained, but moist at all times.

flowering and cherries may appear after two or three years.  high altitude and a carefully managed microclimate are needed for quality.

"'The coffee plant is a woody perennial evergreen dicotyledon that belongs to the Rubiaceae family.  It has a main vertical trunk (orthotropic) and primary, secondary, and tertiary horizontal branches (plagiotropic).  Two main species of coffee are cultivated today.  Coffea arabica known as Arabica coffee accounts for 75-80% of the world's production.  Coffea canephora, known as Robusta coffee, is more robust than the Arabica plants, but produces an inferior tasting beverage with a higher caffeine content.  The coffee plant can grow to heights of 10 meters if not pruned, but producing countries will maintain the coffee at a height reasonable for easy harvesting.

Arabica vs. Robusta? Arabica coffees produce a fine crema, with good aromatics, and a lighter brown-yellow color. Robusta coffees (from the species coffea canefora) make a greater volume of crema, but it has larger "bubbles" and dissipates faster. Robusta has about 2x the caffeine of arabica, 2.2 to 2.4% compared to 1.1 to 1.3% in arabica. It can have a very rubbery-medicinal flavor when there is too much in the espresso blend. At a low percentage, 10% to 15%, it delivers a nice bite and it's negative features can be minimized.

Plant Development: Three to four years after the coffee is planted sweetly smelling flowers grow in clusters in the axils of the leaves.  Fruit is produced only in the new tissue.  The Arabica species is self-pollinating, whereas the Robusta species depends on cross pollination.  About 6-8 weeks after the flowers are fertilized, cell division occurs and the fruit remains as a pin head for a period that is dependent upon the climate.  The ovaries will then develop into drupes in a rapid growth period that takes about 15 weeks after flowering.  During this time the integument takes on the shape of the final bean.  After the rapid growth period the integument and parchment are fully grown and will not increase in size.  The endosperm remains small until about 12 weeks after flowering.  At this time it will suppress, consume, and replace the integument.  The remnants of the integument are what make up the silverskin.  The endosperm will have completely filled the cavity made by the integument nineteen weeks after flowing.  The endosperm is now white and moist, but will gain dry matter during the next several months.  During this time the endosperm attracts more than seventy percent of the total photsynthesates produced by the tree.  The mesocarps will expand to form the sweet pulp that surrounds the bean.  The cherry will change color from green to red about thirty to thirty-five weeks after flowing.

Root System: The root system can extend 20-25 km in total length (Malavolta, 195) and the absorbing surface of a tree ranges from 400 to 500 m2 (Nutman).  There are main vertical roots, tap roots, and lateral roots which grow parallel to the ground.  The tap roots extend no further than 30-45 cm below the soil surface.  Four to eight axial roots may be encountered which often originate horizontally but point downward.  The lateral roots can extend 2 m from the trunk.  About 80-90% of the feeder root is in the first 20 cm of soil and is 60-90 cm away from the trunk of the tree (Mavolta, 195-196).  However, Nutman states that the greatest root concentration is in the 30 to 60 cm depth.  The roots systems are heavily affected by the type of soil and the mineral content of the soil.  To be thick and strong the root system needs an extensive supply of nitrogen, calcium and magnesium. During planting the main vertical roots are often clipped to promote growth of the the horizontal roots, which then have better access to water and added nutrients in the top soil.

Leaves: The elliptical leaves of the coffee tree are shiny, dark green, and waxy.  The leaf area index is between 7 and 8 for a high-yielding coffee (Malavolta, 195).  The coffee plant has become a major source of oxygen in much of the world.  Each hectare of coffee produces 86 lbs of oxygen per day, which is about half the production of the same area in a rain forest (source: Anacafe).

To spur flowering significantly reduce watering for 2-3 months at the beginning of winter.  Watering in spring should shock it into producing flowers.  From this point forward water well and regularly.  Arabica coffee is self-pollenating so you will not need a compainion plant.'" -- http://www.coffeeresearch.org/agriculture/coffeeplant.htm

"'Coffea arabica does not begin to produce its full yield until its sixth year and will continue prime production for about ten years, however Coffee plants may live on for 60 years and grow to between 16 and 40 feet.  Most coffee plantations keep the trees at a manageable six feet for better yield and to ease harvest.

The best growing conditions are in a temperature range of 65 degrees Fahrenheit to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.  Rainfall should be plentiful and the weather should switch between heavy rainfall and sunshine to bring the berries to full maturity. The type of soil is not too important but good drainage is a must.

Coffee plants are fairly easy to grow in the home as a potted specimen, which should be moved outdoors for the summer if possible.

They do best in filtered sunlight, with night temperatures in the lower to mid 60s and day temperatures of 70F or higher. Plant them in any good commercial, fast draining potting soil . The soil should be kept on the moist side, but never soggy.

Coffea arabica are easily propagated from seeds.
You can find seeds for coffea and other rare and unusual plants online from The Whatcom Seed Company

The fruit are red when they ripen in the fall, with a sweet pulp surrounding the bean. Each coffee berry has two beans. The coffee tree's fruit does not all ripen at one time. In fact it will have blossoms and berries in various stages of ripening. Only the ripe berries can be picked. The berries cannot be picked when green since they will not ripen once picked.

There are many commercial coffee roasters.  You may also roast in an oven or toaster oven.  This method will smoke up the house a bit if you do too much at once.

The beans should be placed in some form of perforated container, such as a steel strainer or vegetable steamer. Place them in a pre-heated, 250 degree F. oven for about seven minutes.  Then increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees. In about ten minutes the beans should begin to crackle. (This timing will depend on the temperature, heat capacity of the oven, and the beans; so keep an eye on them.) When the beans start crackling, mix them up, to promote an even roast. Check their color every two minutes until they have achieved a color slightly lighter than the end color which you desire. (As the beans cool, they will continue roasting). When they have completely cooled, store them in an air tight container in the refrigerator...... or grind em, brew em and drink it up!'" -- i don't recall this source

"'You are just about done roasting your beans. The beans should breathe for a period to let the CO2 escape. The problem is letting the beans breathe while keeping the oxygen from coming into contact with your beans. Not as simple as it sounds.

Letting the beans cool to room temperature before doing anything in the way of storage is safe advice.

Some methods used to degas the beans are:

   1. Let them set out exposed to air before sealing (bulk beans in the supermarket are very degassed)
   2. Put them directly in a sealed container
   3. Place them in a bag equipped with a one way air valve'" -- http://www.spacestar.net/users/dwaterfi/roast.html





"'prepare for smoke and chaff output
use the same amount of coffee in the popper that the manufacturer recommends for popcorn.

    * Watch for fragrant smoke and the "first crack" of the beans in about 3 minutes. Wait another minute, then start to monitor beans closely for desired roast color by lifting out butter dish and looking into popping chamber, or, better yet, by smelling the smoke and listening to the crackling.

    * Total time for a lighter roast should be around 4 minutes, full city roast around 5, and darker roasts closer to 6.5 minutes. Roasts develop quickly, so be vigilant. You want to pour the beans out of the popper when they are a tad lighter than the color you desire, since roasting continues until beans are cool.

    * Agitate beans in metal collander with a big spoon or toss between 2 collanders until they are warm to your touch. You may need oven mitts for this. You may want to walk out to a porch to aid cooling.

    * Coffee should be stored out of direct light (and not in a fridge or freezer) in an airtight glass jar, but with a fresh roast, wait 12 hours to seal the jar tightly; it needs to vent off C02.

    * Warm, fresh roasted beans are wonderful, but the coffee attains its peak 4 to 24 hours after roasting. If you store it as recommended, we'll call it fresh for 5 days. When you open that jar in the morning, you will know what fresh coffee truly is.
