Religions often ask adherents to pray or testify or otherwise justify/uphold/explain the church.

These rituals are at least autohypnotic (unless the preacher is aware of the hoax - such as Benny Hinn).  Performed before an audience, these testimonies can create a powerful hypnofascist mob mentality.  Tune into the "Trinity Broadcast Network" sometime and watch one of the 'harvests'.
