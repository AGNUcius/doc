Treat seed tubers carefully. Place them in a clean box or tray - old egg boxes are ideal - with the 'rose' end (the end where the tiny buds can be seen) upwards. Keep in a dark, dry place until you see tiny shoots appearing, then move to a cool (8-10°C), light place. This process, known as 'chitting', encourages the tubers to produce strong, sturdy sprouts, and gives an earlier maturing crop. Tubers can safely stay in their trays until planting conditions are right.
