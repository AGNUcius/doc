Sexual organisms have male and female parts.

The Holy Bible says god created the first female human (Eve) from the first male (Adam).

"'
  26. Then God said, "Let Us make human beings in our image and likeness. And let them rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the animals, over all the land, and over all the small crawling animals on the land."
  27. So God created human beings in His image. In the image of God He created him. He created them male and female.
  28. God blessed them and said to them, "Have many children and grow in number. Fill the land and master it in order to serve God. Rule over the fish in the sea and over the birds in the sky and over every living thing that moves on the land."
  29. God said, "See, I have given you all the tender plants that are seed-bearing which are found over the whole land, and all the trees with sead-bearing fruit. They will be food for you to eat.'" -- The Brown Bible
