Irrigation is a controlled delivery of water, usually to support a biome of organisms.


Sidewalk and roof sloped to fill underground cistern.

Waterproof fabric could protect crops and increase storage when weather is too wet.

Wind assisted pump lifts water if needed.

Automatic irrigation delivers during dry times.

Compress clay and rocks into terrace trenches to carry water further.

Trench banks are walkways and work areas covered with semi-native gifting groundcover.


Auto-irrigate indoor or out with low pressure humidity-sensored feedback.
    Valves at base station.
    Low cost 1/4 inch valves, tubing, connections and heads.
    Low performance microcontroller guides 'turret' style valve.
        More destinations with far less hardware.
        Turret remains fixed; the valve would crawl around to the dry the turret on a rail and connect with each station through an automated quick-attach connection.

Runaway watering is prohibited:
    Valve is closed when:
        No contact with a humidity sensor.
        Sensor reports no humidity increase after some time.
