"'more powerful than the standard military Humvee, is also quicker, and can accelerate faster and climb steeper grades at higher speeds.'" -- http://aec.army.mil/usaec/publicaffairs/update/win99/w9906.htm

"'The only trade-off of the current prototype design is a 540 pound loss of payload, presumably taken by the heavy lead/acid batteries. The hybrid version has a rated payload of 1700 pounds, while the stock version is 2,240 pounds. The GVW for both vehicles is identical at 9,100 pounds.

Another advantage of individual electric drive to each wheel is the Humvee can be made to turn like a tank, locking or reversing the wheels inside the turn, giving the vehicle an unmatched turning radius.'" -- http://www.godspath.com/PAGES/FREEDOM_POLITICS/Pages/HybridHummer/hybrid_humvee_brings_stealth_to_.htm

Mobile power:

The hybrid-electric HMMWV is a portable power plant, capable of powering a mobile command post (TOC) for 24 hours directly from the battery pack (silent mode), or running a silent watch for up to 80 hours. With the hybrid generator engaged, the system can power any variety of loads up to 55 kW indefinitely.
