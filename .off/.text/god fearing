patware responds:

How did you find out
Bush is so moral?
How did you find out
He hasn't had oral?

But What if King Georgie,
Were Muslim instead?
What if he prayed,
About Islam in bed?

Could he love his wife,
In this new way?
Could he still be God-fearing?
What would Allah say?

And what if we were told
Our money should say:
"In Allah we trust".  
It is the only way.

What if religion is just
A game that we play?
What if you die
And find it's just not that way?

'They' say the end is like
"This and like that".
While 'We' say the end is
"Celestial or black."

Their god says one thing,
And your god another.
But what do the Jews say?
And what about the healer?

Who on TV last night,
Healed a woman and two men.
With the might of the psychology
That runs this machine.

Of the psychology that adjusts
Most of what we perceive.
The psychology of fear
Of what we cannot see.

And the need to belong
Before the big scary day.
When the terrorists attack
"Because they hate freedom" they say.

Is it so important
To rely on a ghost?
Why must we pretend
That we know more than most?

It's easy to see
The answer comes from the head,
But when it is you
You think you know it is Him!

So if you were taken
To "Hale Bop" by Doe,
Or convinced of some divinity
By words of the old.

If L. Ron Hubbard told
Our leader to pray,
Would he believe in the answer
And make it that way?

Is that what we want?
Using religion in this way?
Making those in control
Not even to blame?

Since their God runs their thoughts,
But those thoughts are their own,
Religion becomes a curtain
Which can be drawn.

Like Oz to Dorothy,
The elite seem perfect.
But revealing the matter
Is an embarrassing fact.

That shows the folly
Of this war we call peace.
That started with starvation
And is ending the same.

The middle was full
Of the Shock and the Awe.
We warned Saddam to get out
Before we would call.

Our Department of Offense was idle
And waiting for action.
We'd stopped all your food,
And bombed almost daily.

So we pretend your leader
A dangerous threat.
That must be taken with force,
No question 'bout that.

They claim he killed
Some thousands with gas.
So we'll kill twice as many
As we come kick your ass.

Then 20 years later,
We'll pretend that we care.
By dropping big bombs
From high in the air.

For allowing a leader
To take advantage of you.
We will rape and we'll pillage
And kill your children too.

We'll Shock and we'll Awe you
With our Tax payer might.
The cluster bombs are needed
To make you know who is right.

Destroying agriculture centers,
Including water pumping and chicken farms.
Will not fill our stomachs,
Still we'll want more.

Electricity production,
Water purification.
Are two of the things we must stop,
To get at the bad ones.

We kill thousands of acres
Of Pistachio groves.
By stopping the water
And scaring off the farmers of those.

Now we stop your kerosene,
You burn Pistachio wood for heat.
We take your right to bear arms,
You are not fit to be free.

To think that your leader,
Could be someone you elect,
Is folly most pure,
Since only we know what's best

We spend Hundreds of Billions
Of Tax payer dollars
To bomb you at first,
Then clean up the squallor.

The "Power of Pride"
The patriot calls,
The "Plea to Consider"
Rings from Satan's halls.

What if the Vogons decided
Bush is not what we need.
What if they started bombing
The Capitol today?

Billions of times
More powerful are they.
Now they are the bullies,
And we are the prey.

If they asked us
"Should we take him out, or should we kill you?"
What would be your response?
"Do as god would have you do?"

What if a woman
Lived in the sky?
What if she
Were followed as on high?

Making a religion that abhors
The policy of revenge.
And of inflating the pockets
Of those who pretend.

We are the most powerful
Nation, it's true.
But if you measure that might
By what we can do.

Instead of by
The bodies that are strewn.
About the field
The US says is good.

Some do say
"The evil must die."
While others say
"Killing makes evil live."

For those that have nothing,
There is nothing to lose.
So suicide bombing
Becomes valuable.

Our efforts in countries
Abroad and at home.
If examined critically,
Would tell the true story.

Of how our corporations oppress
Those we claim to be freeing.
And killed those in the way
Of fat pockets needing filling.

Big money is dangerous
Big money is fun.
Pretend it doesn't matter,
And the rulers have won.
