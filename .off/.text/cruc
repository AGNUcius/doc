     hanging lamp, an earthen pot for melting metals (cf. OF.
     croisel, creuseul, sort of lamp, crucible, F. creuset

     kr["u]sel, hanging lamp, kroos, kruus, mug, jug, jar, D.
     kroes cup, crucible, Dan. kruus, Sw. krus, E. cruse. It was
     confused with derivatives of L. crux cross (cf. Crosslet),

     prevent the devil from marring the chemical operation. See
     Cruse, and cf. Cresset.]
