"Major labels", the RIAA and Apple are more like each other more than they let on.

    Vassal enforced artificial scarcity and limitations are trademark feudalism turned capitalism

 access hoarding and limits is 
hardware restriction

    Audience monopoly through radio-frequency hoarding.
Artist monopoly through 


 artistic plundering these

I think Elizabeth is poking fun at the idea - saying:  "Overpricing (usury) will only increase infringement".



But whether that is true or not is of no concern to us since we are not the owners.


And the artists are not the owners.

The IP manoralists are the owners.

When feudalist go to far, nations tend to cycle through 'land' (as in finite resources) revolutions.

While these music 'labels' are the conduits from the artist to the consumer, this connection is be 'rerouted' by the internet - so that _legally_copyable_ media, software and design

When artisans retain ownership they have the power to create community.
That is what set the GPL and some CC licenses apart: they disallow some forms of usury.

Apple is usurous on their hardware as well - by disallowing full dominion (as in the ability run your own Operating System became disallowed/disabled following a ROM upgrade).

The problem rests in ownership.  We must become cooperating owners of our "means of production" and (even more importantly), we must retain ownership of our creations so that we can lock them open in a way that will drown the capitalist in overabundance as the GPL will do with all proprietary software vendors ...



... but we must also understand how we need to "make money"
