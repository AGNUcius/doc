Incentives drive action, rewards drive care.

Needs are an incentive for an organism to work, and are usually enough to stabilize a biome until fealty allows hoarders to enforce scarcity for profit through the opposite.

Because of this disease, the normal "Positive Feed Forward, Negative Feed Back" loop is broken.

When rewards are based on applied skill (when you are paid more for doing a better job) you are more likely to be careful, and have incentive to automate the solution.

This is easy to see when you are stranded alone on an island.
