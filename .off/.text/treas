Treasure is treason, for neither $ nor gold are source.

"'Treasury securities are government bonds issued by the United States Department of the Treasury through the Bureau of the Public Debt. They are the debt financing instruments of the U.S. Federal government, and are often referred to simply as Treasuries. There are four types of treasury securities: Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and Savings bonds. All of the Treasury securities (besides savings bonds) are very liquid and are heavily traded on the secondary market.'" -- en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_security
