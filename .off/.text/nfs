NFS is the Network File System

server:
    add something like:
        "/ 192.168.1.100(rw)" to /etc/exports
    maybe run exportfs


client:
    mkdir /mnt/server-name
    mount server-name:/ /mnt/server-name

    //if name resolution is not working:
    mkdir /mnt/192.168.1.101
    mount 192.168.1.101:/ /mnt/192.168.1.101
