  Alcohol \Al"co*hol\ ([a^]l"k[-o]*h[o^]l), n. [Cf. F. alcool,
     formerly written alcohol, Sp. alcohol alcohol, antimony,
     galena, OSp. alcofol; all fr. Ar. al-kohl a powder of
     antimony or galena, to paint the eyebrows with. The name was
     afterwards applied, on account of the fineness of this
     powder, to highly rectified spirits, a signification unknown
     in Arabia. The Sp. word has both meanings. Cf. Alquifou.]
     1. An impalpable powder. [Obs.]
        [1913 Webster]
  
     2. The fluid essence or pure spirit obtained by distillation.
        [Obs.] --Boyle.
        [1913 Webster]
  
     3. Pure spirit of wine; pure or highly rectified spirit
        (called also ethyl alcohol or ethanol, CH3.CH2.OH);
        the spirituous or intoxicating element of fermented or
        distilled liquors, or more loosely a liquid containing it
        in considerable quantity. It is extracted by simple
        distillation from various vegetable juices and infusions
        of a saccharine nature, which have undergone vinous
        fermentation.
  
     Note: [The ferementation is usually carried out by addition
           of brewer's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae to an
           aqueous solution containing carbohydrates.]
           [1913 Webster +PJC]
  
     Note: As used in the U. S. "Pharmacop[oe]ia," alcohol
           contains 91 per cent by weight of ethyl alcohol and 9
           per cent of water; and diluted alcohol (proof spirit)
           contains 45.5 per cent by weight of ethyl alcohol and
           54.5 per cent of water.
           [1913 Webster]
  
     4. (Organic Chem.) A class of compounds analogous to vinic
        alcohol in constitution. Chemically speaking, they are
        hydroxides of certain organic radicals; as, the radical
        ethyl+alcohol+({C2H5.OH">ethyl forms common or ethyl alcohol ({C2H5.OH); methyl
        methyl+alcohol+({CH3.OH">forms methyl alcohol ({CH3.OH) or wood alcohol; amyl
        amyl+alcohol+({C5H11.OH">forms amyl alcohol ({C5H11.OH) or fusel oil, etc.
        [1913 Webster]
