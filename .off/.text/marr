Marriage is an agreement.

I am beginning to understand that marriage doesn't solve the problem that humans need interaction with more than one other person.

Humans need to share space, but have few alternatives to the working and purchasing in spaces owned by external forces who want to 'capitalize' on any possible social mixing that might occur there.

For this reason there are rarely places to sit or even stand unless you pay much more than the true costs of occupying that space.  The natural freedoms to explore, use and share that space are greatly reduced from what they will be when we begin to share these sources in a more efficient manner.

But for now the only way to spend time with another person is to either make a large, exclusionary commitment, or to meet that person in a very temporary manner in somebody else's space.  Space that is not owned or driven by the users of that space, so can only be used in expensive, contrived, freedom-repressed manners.

What I'm trying to say is that marriage is a lonely experience only because it is not a solution to the more general problem that our society lacks centers where humans can share space for "Free as in Freedom(TM)" to work and play, and in this manner we are alienated from each other.

A strange side-effect of owners holding space away from users is that abundance becomes a 'problem' that cannot be solved by sharing.  Let's say you have shares in the ownership of a vinyard that produced especially well this season.  Would you allow the extra grapes to be given away "at cost" (which might mean some work involved) to any hungry soul, or would that be bad for your business?  Would it be 'bad' if the cost of bread (or any product) were driven to the lowest possible cost?  Is employment our goal, or is it a means to an end?  What are our goals?
