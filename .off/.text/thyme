Creeping thyme is especially nice as a ground cover.
Å"'This plant is simplicity itself to grow. Plant in the Spring from divisions. It is widely available at most garden stores  & once you have one plant, it is very EASILY divided. It doesn't require much care. Keep it weeded until established & then it chokes out most weeds. During a recent 2 month drought, I watered it only twice & still it thrived.Å'" -- unknown


Å"'Lemon Thyme, (Thymus x. citriodorus). Perennial Hardy lemon thyme grows in a soft compact mound about 12 inches across and 8 inches high. Plant lemon thyme in full sun, in moderately rich and very well-drained soil. Feed lightly once a year in spring. Plants are quite hardy; in very cold winter areas, give winter protection with straw, salt hay, or oak leaves. Lemon thyme is a non-fussy plant and usually grows disease and pest free. Cooking with Lemon Thyme: Thyme's origins are in the Mediterranean area where it was much loved by the Greeks and Romans. The small evergreen leaves are redolent with the spicy scent of citrus. Lemon thyme is a natural pair with any chicken dish, a perfect herb for seasoning rice and grain dishes, and adds a delightful lemony lift to vegetables and casseroles. It makes a delicate herb butter and is a pleasing surprise in sugar cookies and tea cakes.Å'" -- unknown
