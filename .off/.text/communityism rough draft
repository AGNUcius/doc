locally grown food, medicine, clothing (those required for survival must be located on own property; community owned areas for less vital).

plant more eats.  eat more plants.
a mostly autonomous community or "raising the lowest rung"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
water:
	collect rainwater
    solar still
cistern holds gray water collected from roof and from some washing = for garden use.
    windmill pump to lift water from ground to water tower or inverted bladder in cylinder (to pressurize).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
food:
    how much time/area is needed to grow enough food for 1 person for 1 year?
        time:  gardening has traditionally been a labor intensive activity - partially because that was part of the attraction - killing time in an 'industrious' manner is "relaxing", though some of that may be connected to the guilt harbored (and then released) through heeding the traditional "work ethic" concept.  my limited experience indicates 


    area: www.growbiointensive.org/biointensive/InContext.html claims "... a complete year's diet for one person can be raised on the equivalent of 3,403 square feet.".  3400 ft^2 ==  0.0781221303949 acre (less than 1/10th of an acre).

    cultivation: indigenous as normal (square-foot-gardening syle).  others in greenhome.  many within the living area.  imagine date, olive, orange, avocado, apple, cherry, banana, grapes, wheat, barley, oats, greenbeans, pinto,

    preparation:
        cook with:
			 solar cooking
			 gas from digester
        grind wheat
        beer, whiskey, wine
	hot water
	cooking
	pottery kiln
	even steel and glass working if the mirror array is large enough.  imagine computer controlled mirrors on every home.  during 


    storage:
        it is possible to keep many foods in a root-cellar for many months if the correct temperature/humidity is maintained (which can be done for 0cost if careful about design/location)
        refrigeration
            utilize winter climate if applicable by opening a top-duct -
        freezing: 

        solar food dehydrator
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
shelter:

thermally neutral shelter (little or no heating/cooling: acheived through straw-bales, passive solar, careful landscaping).  
glass on south for winter heating and green-room food growing area.

living quarters located in the more arid end of greenhome
    material: ideas: bamboo framed geodesics with double paned translucent triangles from recycled glass or plastic.
    heating: Shade trees must drop leaves early.  Possibly some digester radiation; passive solar with optional mirrors; wood chip stove, distilled alcohol.
    cooling: careful tree placement, : Underground convection chimney pulls air from shade side of house for lowest intake temperature fed throught an evaporative cooler, and finally a refridgerator coils used to , then electrically assisted.

    ventlation: simple wind powered roof vents can create vacuum or pressure.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hygine:
    Hot water from simple solar exposed pipe (CAUTION: Some pipe materials release toxins when heated.)
    one-piece-toothbrush that never needs replacing.
        baking soda paste.
        make own handsoap, shampoo, laundry, dish.
    lowenergy dishwasher:  mostly trickle soaks the dishes, with water being actively cleaned (grease skimmed, particles caught; all to digester of course) - but with no moving parts.  it's easy to skim grease when the water is moving slow (as it is), the heavy particles leave dropping to the digester (requiring the dishwasher be mounted high - 2nd floor is perfect), lighter particles may require moving parts - self cleaning, water powered, rotating cylindrical filters remove them in stages.  this produces the precurser to potable water - which is then fed to the solar still.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
waste:
    digester
    since almost no external products will be consumed, there won't be dumpsters full of containers (bottles, cans, bags, boxes).  what remains in production should be recycled [why is recycling _still_ not mandatory?]
    composting toilets have been available for more than 20 years.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
energy production: methane, ethanol, solar cells, battery sink, hydrogen production, fuel cells

energy storage: battery sink, hydrogen production, fuel cells

    Potential energy collection: slowly raise massive (possibly hundreds of tons) weight when energy production exceeds need.  When need exceeds production, use weight to drive generator.  A small battery bank buffers the transition.  House weight in underground shaft for saftey and ease of construction.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
transportation: human/solar/battery assisted.  conveyor belt for mass transit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
communication:
    wireless internet (should be UWB) for telephone, artistic creation/consumption, education, publication

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    the more difficult items (soap, fabric, clothing, shoes, etc.) could initially be purchased as normal, but could eventually be made at a multi-community level - when many communities are close enough together to share in that way.  organizing in that way is already in place (to some degree) at the city and county levels.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
defense/police etc:
    there is a definite need for some form of protection from both internal and external problem makers.  one of the most often claimed reasons that ideas like communityism won't pan out is because of the 'bad apples' that spoil the whole bunch when people are given "too much" freedom.  this is a very real problem, but is no different (would not be amplified) from our current situation.  in fact, since everyone will have at least enough to live, there will be less reason to risk your life in an attempt to be "set for the rest of your life" - which seems to be part of the reasoning a burglar may use when considering such an act.  we will still need a military to protect us from forces trying to cause problems for whatever reason.  then again, if communityism works to its full potential, there will be very little reason for a country to attack another - as everyone will already have what they need.  if products (especially those which fill basic human needs) are made artificially scarce (as they are now) the desire to 'go somewhere else, and kill those responsible for the scarcity (or at least take some of what the more well-to-do society has)' becomes less likely.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
population:  we need to be educated about the very basics of population growth.  for instance, my friends wife (who is pregnant) mentioned her relative considers it socially irresponsible to have more than 2 children per couple.  she then rolled her eyes and exclaimed "of course they know we are 'members'" (referring to their membership in the Mormon church) - which promotes large families.  certainly it is her 'right' to produce as many children as she (more specifically her church) wants, but she apparently doesn't buy into the concept of many children being a problem.  it is trivial math.  whatever the number may be, the earth can support a finite number of creatures.  if each person produces more than one replacement, the population will have an increasing trend.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
glossary:

an explanation about the 'needs' list:  when describing to others the idea of determining their needs i find people become agitated, even angry as they often think i'm laying down a law as to what one would be 'allowed' to have.  this is a misconception.  implementing communityism will not require the creation of new laws.  laws are created when person A wants person B to do something that B doesn't want to do.  communityism is not about changing those that don't want to change.  it is about educating people until they realize it _is_ what they want.  determining needs is not about restricting choice.  it is used in several other ways:

    1. if citizens are educated about what they _must_ (as opposed to what they've been told, or have assumed) they need they can make informed decisions about how to use their time.
    the current use of time for most people has to do with working an excessive amount for a company and job for which they may have little interest.  'work' is considered a neccessary part of our lives.  i'm not suggesting there will be no need for _any_ work (after all, you'll have to plant the seeds and pick the fruit [plus there will be the intial work of building your shelter and energy equipment]), but after much study i'm fully convinced we do not need to spend our time furthering the cause of the upper-strata 1% of the population (the billionaires that run the food/clothing/entertainment/software industries).  we are slaves to the system because we've bought into the lie that this is the way to finally acheive financial stability.

needs:  things required for existence [oxygen, water, food, defense, waste management]
basic human needs:  things requried for a 'comfortable' life [shelter, clothing, transportation, health care, art]
extended human needs:  things that are nice to have, and may be worth the trouble, as they are so beneficial [electricity, computers, ]


thoughts:
    fresh water supply.  vegetarianism [as livestock consume so much fresh water - plus the extra crops required to feed N people when the plants are first turned into flesh.]
    pollution.  lowered energy consumption, solar
    foreign oil dependence.  lowered energy consumption, local solar electricity, solar water heating, 

    we cannot rely on the big-business/government monster to help us.  in fact, they will actively oppose us, and create problems to ensure their money continues to flow based upon artificial scarcity.  the only approach is a bottom-up awakening.  each citizen must be educated in the ways of becoming self sustaining.
