To me, 'proprietary' means property under usury.

The GPL locks gates open to protect the commons from feudalist proprietors who would otherwise begin to hoard and scarcify


"'proprietary:
    c.1450, "possessing worldly goods in excess of a cleric's needs," from M.L. proprietarius "owner of property," noun use of L.L. adj. proprietarius "of a property holder," from L. proprietas "owner" (see property). Meaning "held in private ownership" is first attested 1589.'" -- www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Proprietary

"'proprietor:
    1639, "owner, by royal grant, of an American colony," probably from proprietary (n.) in sense "property owner" (1473, see proprietary). In general sense of "one who holds something as property" it is attested from 1645.'" -- www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=proprietor
