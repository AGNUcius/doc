Some notes about how to get NetBSD up and running:

Preinstall
----------------
Split up drive with parted?

Install any locked closed OSes

Boot with NetBSD CD, floppy, bootp, DHCP

wget ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-2.0/i386/installation/floppy/boot-big.fs

Answer annoying questions because of incorrect defaults:
  Attn. Sysinst Maintainers:  RET should always move in the the most sane manner.

Set NetBSD partition as: 'active'.  I also set 'default' and 'install', but maybe didn't need to.

Reboot


Networking
-------------
  If you are on a DHCP network just say:
    dhclient

  To view your network condition:
    ifconfig -a

  For DNS troubles:
  (add-line "option domain-name-servers 10.3.144.60, 10.3.144.61" "/etc/dhclient.conf")

  man netstat
  man route

SOFTWARE
-----------
  INITIAL source tree
  -------------------
    cd /usr
    wget ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc.tar.gz # USER=anonymous PASS=")
    tar -xzpf pkgsrc.tar.gz

  UPDATING source tree
  --------------------
    cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot login #USER:anoncvs PASS:anoncvs
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot update -d -P

  SECURITY tasks
  --------------
  cd /usr/pkgsrc/security/audit-packages
  make install
  /usr/pkg/sbin/download-vulnerability-list

  EXAMPLE install
  ---------------
    cd /usr/pkgsrc/editors/emacs
    make install

    cd /usr/pkgsrc/wm/wmii
    make install ALLOW_VULNERABLE_PACKAGES=YES

    CLEANUP after an install:
    make clean CLEANDEPENDS=YES

  BINARY PACKAGES
  ---------------
  setenv PKG_PATH ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/2.0/i386/All
  pkg_add -v perl

  PROBLEMS
  --------
    setenv FTP_PASSIVE_MODE true

KEYBOARD
--------
  To make the meta (or "Alt") key work for emacs on the console:
    (add-line "encoding us.metaesc" "/etc/wscons.conf")

  To make "Caps Lock" act like the "Ctrl" key:
    On the console [caution: this can cause trouble if you suddenly exit from X with CAPS_LOCK on]
      (add-line "mapfile /usr/share/wscons/keymaps/pckbd.caps2ctrl" "/etc/wscons.conf")
      (add-line "keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L" "/usr/share/wscons/keymaps/pckbd.caps2ctrl")

    in X: see X setup
    edit ~/.xmodmap to look like:
        remove Lock = Caps_Lock
        remove Control = Control_L
        keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
        add Control = Control_L

    or (this didn't work for me)
        in /etc/X11/XF86Config add the line
            Option     "XkbOptions"             "ctrl:nocaps"
        to the "Device" section

    problems:
        C-/ sends a literal /  my undo key!  use C-_ instead.  How do I fix this?

X Window
-------
  SETUP
  -----
    Generate /etc/X11/XF86Config:
      run xf86cfg and press OK

      if that doesn't work, try xf86config:
        emulate 3 buttons?  y if 2button mouse, n otherwise
        mouse device?  /dev/wsmouse

  START
  -----
  /usr/startx  will begin the X session
      If it fails, look at the output and run xf86config again or edit /etc/X11/XF86Config by hand.
      use Ctrl-Alt-NumPad-- and Ctrl-Alt-NumPad-+ (hold down both the Ctrl and Alt keys while pressing the - or + keys on the Num Pad) to change resolutions
      use Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to abort the X session (especially useful if your mouse type or device is wrong)

  to change window managers:
    build a wm in /usr/pkgsrc/wm

    edit ~/.xinitrc to look something like:
        emacs&
        exec ratpoison

----optimizations:
    soft updates:
        /etc/fstab example:
            /dev/wd0e /usr ffs rw,softdep 1 2


/dev/wd0a / ffs rw,softdep 1 1
/dev/wd0b none swap sw 0 0
/dev/wd0e /usr ffs rw,softdep 1 2


----SAMBA NETWORKING (that's SMB, which is Microsoft's "folder sharing" networking):
(add-line "nmbd=YES # NetBIOS over IP" "/etc/rc.conf")
(add-line "smbd=YES # SMB/CIFS server" "/etc/rc.conf")


sharity-light:

cd /usr/pkgsrc/net/sharity-light
make install

mkdir /mnt/smb

#if you want netbios naming, make an entry in /etc/hosts

shlight //host/share /mnt/smb -U username -P password

#to unmount:
unshlight /mnt/smb




----RESEARCH:
/etc/rc.sysctl
/etc/sysctl.conf 
  I don't understand how to change the tty or vt emulation or whatever it is that makes me start in vt100 instead of a more featureful interface like vt220... I think this is not the right terminology, but I'm talking about more colors, resolutions, column widths, fonts, etc.

emacs          GNU editing macros (editor)
wget           Retrieve files from the 'net via HTTP and FTP
tightvnc       Display X and Win32 desktops on remote X/Win32/Java displays

Subject: Xft and anti-aliased fonts on NetBSD (a short howto)

I've written a short howto on configuring anti-aliased fonts with NetBSD.
Comments / suggestions are welcome.

Cheers,

How to setup anti-aliased fonts on NetBSD with XFree86 4

    NOTE: The paths below should be adjusted appropriately if using xpkgwedge

    1. Install the following packages from pkgsrc:
        fonts/ms-ttf
        fonts/mkfontscale
        fonts/fontconfig
    2. Setup the font hints:
        mkfontscale /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType
        mkfontdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType
       There should now be a 'fonts.dir' and 'fonts.scale' in the
       TrueType font directory.
    3. Configure the X server:
        a. In the "Module" section, make sure that the following exists:
        Load "type1"
        Load "freetype"
        b. In the "Files" section, verify the order of the font paths.
           Verify that the TrueType and Type1 font paths are before
           the rest:
            FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/local/"
            FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType/"
            FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/"
            FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
            FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/:unscaled"
            FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/:unscaled"
            FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
            FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/"
    4. Configure Xft -- an example /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XftConfig follows:

##### Example XftConfig
dir "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType"
dir "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1"
# Uncomment the following line if using an LCD display
#match edit rgba = rgb;
match any family == "fixed"             edit family =+ "mono";
includeif       "~/.xftconfig"
match any family == "Times"             edit family += "Times New Roman";
match any family == "Helvetica"         edit family += "Verdana";
match any family == "Courier"           edit family += "Courier New";
match any family == "serif"             edit family += "Times New Roman";
match any family == "sans"              edit family += "Verdana";
match
        any family == "mono"
        all slant == roman
        all weight < bold
edit
        family += "monotype.com";
match any family == "mono"              edit family += "Courier New";
match any family == "Charter"           edit family += "Bitstream Charter";
match any family == "Bitstream Charter" edit family =+ "Charter";
match any family == "Lucidux Serif"     edit family += "LuciduxSerif";
match any family == "LuciduxSerif"      edit family =+ "Lucidux Serif";
match any family == "Lucidux Sans"      edit family += "LuciduxSans";
match any family == "LuciduxSans"       edit family =+ "Lucidux Sans";
match any family == "Lucidux Mono"      edit family += "LuciduxMono";
match any family == "LuciduxMono"       edit family =+ "Lucidux Mono";
match any family == "Comic Sans"        edit family += "Comic Sans MS";
match any family == "Comic Sans MS"     edit family =+ "Comic Sans";
match any family == "Trebuchet"         edit family += "Trebuchet MS";
match any family == "Trebuchet MS"      edit family =+ "Trebuchet";
match any family == "Monotype"          edit family =+ "Monotype.com";
match any family == "Andale Mono"       edit family += "Monotype.com";
match any family == "Monotype.com"      edit family =+ "Andale Mono";
##### End of XftConfig

    5. Rebuild the font cache for applications that use fontconfig:
        fc-cache -v
       This will take a very long time (~20 minutes on a PII 366),
       so be patient.
    6. That's it! Restart the X server, and test the configuration:
        xterm -ls -fg gray -bg black -ls -fa "Courier New Bold" -fs 10
