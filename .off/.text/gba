"'GBA DEV :
¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨

CAN I CREATE MY OWN GBA GAME?
Yes, you can. You need some knowledge about the programming language C++, C or ASM. I would say C++ is the way to go. Then you need some hardware and software. Basically you can do everything with software, but it's better to test your game on real hardware then with a software emulation of the hardware. To do that you need a FlashLinker.

What software do I need? You can start coding the GBA with a text editor and a compiler like devkitadv, but it's much easier with an Integrated Development Enviroment. VisualHAM is a great IDE that is based around the HAM lib that makes coding the GBA much easier and it's free.

Then you need to know the hardware of the GBA. The GBA has some limits and advantages you better know before you start coding. Here's a basic spec list:

CPU Modes
ARM Mode ARM7TDMI 32bit RISC CPU, 16.78MHz, 32bit opcodes (GBA)
THUMB Mode ARM7TDMI 32bit RISC CPU, 16.78MHz, 16bit opcodes (GBA)
CGB Mode Z80/8080-style 8bit CPU, 4.2MHz or 8.4MHz (CGB compatibility)
DMG Mode Z80/8080-style 8bit CPU, 4.2MHz (monochrome gameboy compatib.)
