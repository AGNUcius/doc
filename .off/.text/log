Logos-OS.DFKI.de "'The LOGOS Machine translation system is one of the largest and most powerful among the commercial machine translation systems. Various text documents in different formats can be submitted to the system and within a short amount of time are translated into different target languages. The result, a raw translation, is already of high language quality. But if required, the result can be post-edited by a human translator. The user saves a significant amount of time and costs especially since the use of different document filters maintain the format of the original document to a high degree.'"
