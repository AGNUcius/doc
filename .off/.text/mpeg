MPEGLA.com "'A patent is the grant of a property right covering an invention. The right conferred by the patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing the invention in the absence of a license. Where standards and other technology platforms consist of many patents owned by many patent owners, the number of licenses required of users may be too costly and inefficient for users to negotiate. This is often referred to as a patent thicket. By increasing uncertainty and conflict and restricting freedom of movement surrounding use of a technology, a patent thicket may impede its adoption, interoperability and use.'"
