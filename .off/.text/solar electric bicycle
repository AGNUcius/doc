From sea level to summit-Dallas Pass, Rocky Mountains, Colorado

Early last year, I built a solar-electric
bicycle. On this solar and human
powered rig, I rode from San
Francisco, California, to Carbondale,
Colorado, arriving just in time to start a
summer of classes at Solar Energy
International. In the summer of 2001, I
will go to China, and continue solar
cycling around the world.
I was installing residential PV systems in the San
Francisco Bay area when I had the idea to build a solar
cycle. In January 2000, I decided to not only build it, but
to live with it. The primary motivation was (and still is)
the satisfaction of living and sharing a sustainable
lifestyle free of materialism. I get to meet new people in
new places, share ideas, spend days outside using my
body, sleep under the stars, and allow life to unfold as
taking the risk of the unknown pays off.
Ultimate Test
The trip was also the ultimate test for developing the
solar cycle. After the first 30 miles, I realized that I
needed a stronger PV mount. After 100 miles, I realized
that I needed brakes for the trailer. After 1,000 miles, I
realized that I needed a trailer with spoked wheels. And
after 1,500 miles, I finally decided that I needed a more
powerful motor.
Cycling is the best way to see the world. It takes time,
so you experience the places you ride through.
Although I took roughly three and a half months to ride
the 2,000 miles (3,200 km), I spent less than half of that
time actually traveling. The rest of the time I spent
hanging out in towns, modifying the rig, meeting people,
backpacking, et cetera.
The coast was good training. I started with 30 mile (50
km) days, and was fine with 60 milers (100 km) by the
time I hit the mountains in Prescott, Arizona. The looks I
got from cars while riding over passes were priceless. It
sounds like a lot of work, but the riding simply put me in
the necessary shape, and then kept me there. Of
course it took about two weeks to fall out of shape once
I stopped riding.
I rode mostly on two-lane highways (50­60 mph;
80­100 kph speed limit) that were generally not overly
congested. Still, cars were a constant threat to my life.
The few roads that were two-lane, with no shoulder
and heavy semi traffic going 65 mph (105 kph), forced
me to come to grips with my mortality. On one of these

roads, a semi forced me into the sand shoulder.
Luckily, I was able to lay the bike down as my trailer
tipped, and the car behind him pulled over to make
sure I was okay.
I often camped out in national forests, but there were
many nights out in the desert, a quarter mile off the
highway. I also stayed with kind people I met along the
way. I am still so inspired by all the people who reached
out to do whatever they could for me, and took serious
interest in my journey. Some were people who have
been living with PV systems for years, but there were
also people who didn't know that solar-electric systems
really work.
Extremes
I got a taste of extremes in Springerville, Arizona,
allegedly the windiest town in the country. I rode into
record (for the day) winds up to 75 mph (120 kph)! I
also rode through record heat (for those days in April) in
the Mojave Desert. I drank five gallons (19 l) of water in
a day and a half, crossing the totally remote 120 mile
(190 km) stretch on highway 62 from 29 Palms,
California to Parker, Arizona. It was not until I arrived in
Parker caked with salt that I was told that I'd done it in
110 degree (43°C) heat.
The following day, my original motor overheated after 5
miles (8 km). So I rode another 30 miles (48 km) in
100+ degree heat without any assist at all. I practically
passed out before I decided to hitch a ride out of the
low desert.
The next morning I was picked up by a pickup truck and
dropped off outside of Prescott-50 miles (80 km) down
the road, 1,000 feet (300 m) higher, and 15°F (8°C)
cooler. After running out of spare tubes for my trailer in
between towns a few times, I became pretty confident
that I could get a ride from a pickup truck whenever I
needed it.
Once I arrived in Carbondale, I landed in a teepee
belonging to an SEI employee, and lived there on a
picturesque hillside for the summer. During this time, I
disconnected my trailer (it takes a matter of minutes). I
used it as the power source at the off-grid SEI
campground, while using my bike to commute to
classes.
The SEI workshops I took were excellent opportunities
to further my renewable energy education. They
included
Renewable Energy in the Developing World,
Microhydro, Wind Power,
and
Advanced Photovoltaics.
I found out that intense training in renewable energy is

only part of the SEI experience. It
also includes making friends,
having a blast, and networking for
future projects.
In fact, I would not be riding through
Asia so soon had I not met my solar
cycling partner, Colin Mitchell, at
SEI over the summer. When I
finished up at SEI, I took a train
back home to Vermont, where I will
be until next summer, when the
Asian tour begins.
Performance
The rig has a 24 VDC system. In full
sun, the array of four Solarex MSX
Lite modules produces 4 to 5 amps.
My trailer weighs 190 pounds (86
kg) empty, and I pulled an additional
85 to 100 pounds (39­45 kg) of
gear. On flat ground, I can cruise at 18 mph (29 kph)
without pedaling, with the motor drawing 13 amps.
I tested the range of the bike on flat ground, with an
unloaded trailer and a 150 pound (68 kg) rider, from full
battery to empty battery (100% SOC to 20% SOC).
With no pedaling and no sunshine, it has a range of 25
to 30 miles (40­50 km). With no pedaling, but with good
sun, the solar cycle has a range of 35 to 40 miles
(55­65 km). When pedaling, the rider's fitness level
becomes the only limit.
On my journey, I averaged 45 miles (72 km) a day on
my travel days, pedaling consistently at a moderate
pace, averaging 12 mph (19 kph). Typically I would start
the day (late morning) with the batteries at about 24.5
volts, and finish the day at dusk at about 24 volts. I
would often reach 25+ volts by midday, because I didn't
rely heavily on the motor until later in the day, when I
was tired, and also more confident in the battery's state
of charge.
Components
This solar cycle consists of a cargo trailer with a canopy
of PV. The trailer is manufactured by Bikes At Work,
and is 2 feet wide by 6 feet long (0.6 x 1.8 m), plus a
couple feet in the trailer tongue. It has an impressive
300 pound (135 kg) capacity, and is mostly aluminum.
The trailer carries the batteries, which power a 24 V
pedal-assist electric motor on my bike, which in turn
drives the bike's rear wheel.
The solar canopy consists of four Solarex MSX-30 Lites
(30 W each). They are glassless and frameless
polycrystalline panels. Initially, I had them mounted
directly onto angle aluminum. But they are not rigid, so
when I rode over a bump they would flap, which
damaged some of the conductor joints.
My month's rent in Berkeley, California ran out the day
before I finished building the rig, so rather than waste a
month's rent, I decided to work out the bugs on the
road. In Santa Barbara, I finally received my new
modules. This time I mounted them on plywood, and
suspended it from a rigid perimeter, first with latex
tubing, which lasted about a month in the sun, and then
with bungee cords.
This fall, I mounted the modules on plywood, and
mounted that on angle-bar, similar to my first rack. The
backing keeps the modules from flapping, which
appears to be sufficient protection. Next time I will use a
single 120 W framed module.
The 10 A Solar Converters charge controller (model PT
12/24-5) was originally a 5 A controller, but the
manufacturer put in a 10 A diode and fuse, and said it
would be fine. It is a maximum power point tracker, with
David Clay, spreading the renewable word.

standard three-stage charging. It
works with 12 to 24 V input and
output, and is over 94 percent
efficient.
The battery pack consists of two
Dynasty 33 AH, 12 V, sealed lead-
acid batteries in series. They lie on
their sides with the control/fuse
board on top of them, while snugly
contained in a mini Rubbermaid
Action Packer.
Trailer Tales
Hitching the trailer to the rear wheel
axle area (as opposed to the seat
post) with a universal ball joint gives
great stability and tracking.
Unfortunately, the 16 inch (40 cm)
plastic rimmed wheels frequently
blew tubes and ate through tires,
although they were problem-free for the first 800 miles
(1,300 km). I tried to get spoked wheels for the trailer,
but could not find any that were compatible.
My trailer weighed 280 pounds (127 kg) with all my
gear, which posed a great threat to my safety when
going down steep, winding hills. I learned this in
Monterey, California when the trailer jackknifed and I
flipped going 20 mph (32 kph). After a day of white
knuckles and sheer terror on the steep winding cliffs of
Big Sur, I hitched a ride in a pickup back to Monterey,
where I put brakes on the trailer.
A friendly machinist (one of many along the way)
supplied me with a piece of aluminum bar, which we
laid across the trailer behind the wheels. We bolted the
brake mount horizontally on the bar. A local bike shop
set me up with a little brake cable component that
splits a single brake line into two lines. So I had a
single brake lever for the trailer that pulled on the
brakes for both wheels simultaneously. I think the heat
from friction of the brakes warped the plastic rim, which
might have led to the frequent tire problems. But the
brakes were essential.
Motor
Originally I had a pedal-assist motor setup called the
US Pro Drive (model B-CTI-3VP-K), made by Currie
Bicycles. It is a 400 W brush-type motor, with an
integrated controller. The motor is mounted on a drive
train that mounts onto the spoke base of the rear
wheel, and provides a 14 to 1 reduction, with the help
of a built-in planetary gear. It is a very tidy and
compact setup, but I found that the motor would
overheat on a daily basis, even when it was running
below 16 A (400 W).

It wasn't until I was in Durango, Colorado, on the
doorstep of the trip's most brutal passes, that I finally
got the Scott 1 hp motor (model 4BB-O2488). I
removed the Currie motor from its drive train, replaced
it with a sprocket on a shaft, and mounted the motor
and controller on the bike's rear rack (which needs
reinforcement for long-term use).
The Scott is also a 24 V brush-type motor. Even with
my fully loaded trailer, it never overheated going over
11,000 foot (3,350 m) passes. For both motors, I used a
5 K ohm potentiometer, with a volume dial mounted on
my handlebars for a variable speed throttle.
Electronics
The 175 A Curtis motor controller (model 1204/5) was
more than the rig required. A 60 A controller would have
been sufficient. But when I was rebuilding the motor
setup in Durango, it was easier to get both the motor
and the controller from the same supplier. I found that
both the Curtis and my original controller attempted to
maintain a constant motor rpm. This meant that when I
hit an incline, the motor drew more current, though I
would have preferred my pedaling to absorb the change
in terrain. As a result, I found myself having to fiddle
with the throttle in order to reset the rpm.
I chose the E-Meter because I had planned to use the
RS232 port to download data onto my laptop (though I
never got around to it). It was small enough for my
handlebars, once I found the right plastic jam container
to put it in. All the bike really needed was a digital
volt/amp meter, at a quarter the price of the E-Meter I
used.
I carried a battery charger with me in case of prolonged
periods without sun. Although I spent countless nights
where I had access to the grid, I never used it after I got
my PV array working. On the other hand, charging from
the grid is what got me from San Francisco to Santa
Barbara, after I broke my first PV array. Luckily, most of
those nights were spent at coastal campgrounds where
the grid is often found in the bathrooms.
Loads & Loads
The majority of the extra weight was in the PV backing
and rack (which ended up being steel, after meeting a
friend in Santa Barbara who had steel and a steel
welder, and not aluminum). Wire, hardware, fuses, lugs,
bungees, and the plywood underneath the battery box
all add up to a lot of weight.
My Taiwanese-made Amcamex modified sine wave
inverter, 24 VDC to 110 VAC (model MP-140X), gave
An E-Meter monitors battery state of charge.

me the ability to power AC electronics off the solar
panels. The boom box was the only load that got
consistent use besides the motor. I found pedaling to
the rhythm of my personal music selections to be
blissful-it made riding even more enjoyable than it
already was.
I used my laptop computer in conjunction with my cell
phone to wirelessly connect to the Internet. I also have
a special analog modem that allows me to go online
where a digital signal is not available, which was
necessary considering I was out of digital range as
soon as I left the coast. I mostly used my wireless
capability for email. I would save my Web surfing for
when I had access to a land line, since wireless data is
still very slow (under 1 KBPS).
I also started the journey with an AC compact florescent
light, and an AC, AA battery charger for the nickel-metal
hydride AAs in the bike lights. Both of these appliances
were soon sent home in one of my frequent attempts to
ditch weight. I never used either of them when I had
them, and never missed them when they were gone.
Candles provided all the illumination I needed at a
fraction of the weight and twice the ambiance. And I
never rode with my trailer after dark, so a single charge
on my bike light batteries lasted the entire trip.
Solarcycling.com
I am starting a small business selling solar trikes and
trailers over the Internet. Initially, I am focusing on the
solar-powered recumbent tricycle. Rather than having
the PV canopy over the trailer, as my first solar cycle
had, the PV is over the trike, providing shade and rain
cover. Recumbent trikes have two wheels in the front,
and because they are very low to the ground, they are
incredibly stable. Like the solar trailer, the solar trike is
also a contained and mobile power station.
Other than selling solar cycles, the main objective of
solarcycling.com is to teach people how to build their
own solar cycle. My real goal is to spread inspiration,
creativity, and knowledge, so people can be
empowered to make lifestyle changes.
Asian Tour
Any profits made by solarcycling.com will help fund a
planned journey through Asia. My friend Colin Mitchell
and I are going to ride a couple of solar trikes through
China, Southeast Asia, India, and possibly into Europe,
beginning in 2001. It is an open-ended journey that may
take years-anything might happen. Lifestyle speaks so
much louder than words, while the adventures and
revelations are endless.

We plan to hook up with as many alternative
organizations as we can. We will be checking in with the
rest of the world by posting regular updates, photos,
and possibly video on the solarcycling.com Web site.
We seek publicity, contacts, support, ideas, and wish to
involve as many people as possible. We are also
considering the possibility of like-minded sponsors to
help fund this adventure. Anyone with any kind of
interest is personally encouraged to get in touch with us.
In an ongoing attempt for personal development, solar
cycling has become more than low-impact
transportation. Solar cycling is my way of life, based on
empowerment and unified love-free from the self-
enslavement and unobserved devastation of
consumerism.
