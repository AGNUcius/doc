I only hope I can edit this post later, so I can update on a progresss... Why isnt it a wiki???

I bought this motherboard for a media center PC to attach to my LCD HDTV. It's a decent board with a good integrated graphics card, DVI &amp; SPDIF outputs, 64-bit etc.

Here is wisdom i gathered so far:
- Disable MMIO in bios, it won't work
- You must boot with &quot;noapic nolapic&quot; options for a &quot;generic&quot; kernel to work. It will &quot;work&quot; enough for you to install a base system - ide will be very slow, interrupts will get lost etc.
- Build a custom kernel as soon as you can. APIC will work fine (and has to be enabled back) on a custom built kernel.
- ACPI DSDT is broken. I was unable to dump/dfix it yet, currently working on it...
- The only display driver that works is an ATI propritary driver. Haven't installed it yet...

Hardware / drivers:

ide - ATI IXP PCI busmaster DMA
sata - SCSI, Silicon image 3112
nic - Realtek 8139too

Overall - so far it seems to be a good motherboard, the only thing that it is a new model gives a lot of headache...
