I own an ATI 9700 All In Wonder.  The "All In Wonder" part means it has a TV tuner.

The hoarding bastards won't release the specification so the laborers attempting to make a full driver for GNU/Linux (for example) have not been able to do their job (which they would do for free by the way).

On Windows XP the 'Display Properties' dialog allowed me to change the vertical refresh rate to 85_hz, but the monitor was only being driven to 75_hz.  My sensetivity to rates below 85 was causing headaches.  After poking around in the 'Advanced' section i found an area with a checkbox indicating the use of DDC to determine the monitor's capabilities.  Since the Viewsonic G810 that I use reports erroneously low values, unchecking this box allowed me to finally change the highest allowed refresh to 85.
