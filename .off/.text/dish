Dish states:
  Dirty: on table or being carried to tray at input door.
  Dirty: one or two trays straddling sink or splash area at input door.
  Clean: one or two tray at output door.
  Clean: most tray slid into cupboard tracks.

Cleaned trays (still full of dishes/silverware) may be slid into shelfless cupboards designed to accept them.

This could cause scattering unless you pay some attention, and try to clump things in familiar areas.

Lower this impact by:
  Storing low-use items out of trays.
