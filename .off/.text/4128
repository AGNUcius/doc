21   SEC. 7. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RURAL AMERICA.

22       (a) FINDINGS.--The Congress finds the following:
23            (1) The founders realized the fundamental im-
24       portance of property rights when they codified the
25       Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Con-


      HR 4128 EH
                               7
 1       stitution, which requires that private property shall
 2       not be taken ``for public use, without just compensa-
 3       tion''.
 4            (2) Rural lands are unique in that they are not
 5       traditionally considered high tax revenue-generating
 6       properties for State and local governments. In addi-
 7       tion, farmland and forest land owners need to have
 8       long-term certainty regarding their property rights
 9       in order to make the investment decisions to commit
10       land to these uses.
11            (3) Ownership rights in rural land are funda-
12       mental building blocks for our Nation's agriculture
13       industry, which continues to be one of the most im-
14       portant economic sectors of our economy.
15            (4) In the wake of the Supreme Court's deci-
16       sion in Kelo v. City of New London, abuse of eminent
17       domain is a threat to the property rights of all pri-
18       vate property owners, including rural land owners.
19       (b) SENSE        CONGRESS.--It is the sense of Con-
                     OF

20 gress that the use of eminent domain for the purpose of
21 economic development is a threat to agricultural and other
22 property in rural America and that the Congress should
23 protect the property rights of Americans, including those
24 who reside in rural areas. Property rights are central to
25 liberty in this country and to our economy. The use of


      HR 4128 EH
                                8
 1 eminent domain to take farmland and other rural property
 2 for economic development threatens liberty, rural econo-
 3 mies, and the economy of the United States. The taking
 4 of farmland and rural property will have a direct impact
 5 on existing irrigation and reclamation projects. Further-
 6 more, the use of eminent domain to take rural private
 7 property for private commercial uses will force increasing
 8 numbers of activities from private property onto this Na-
 9 tion's public lands, including its National forests, National
10 parks and wildlife refuges. This increase can overburden
11 the infrastructure of these lands, reducing the enjoyment
12 of such lands for all citizens. Americans should not have
13 to fear the government's taking their homes, farms, or
14 businesses to give to other persons. Governments should
15 not abuse the power of eminent domain to force rural
16 property owners from their land in order to develop rural
17 land into industrial and commercial property. Congress
18 has a duty to protect the property rights of rural Ameri-
19 cans in the face of eminent domain abuse.
20   SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.

21        In this Act the following definitions apply:
22             (1)   ECONOMIC                              term

17                  trol facility, pipeline, or similar use;
18                  (B) removing harmful uses of land pro-
19           vided such uses constitute an immediate threat
20           to public health and safety;
21                  (C) leasing property to a private person or
