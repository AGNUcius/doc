The Great Seal on the US DOLLAR says "E Pluribus Unum" = "From many one".

"'The motto itself has thirteen letters.  The motto was selected by the first Great Seal committee in 1776, at the beginning of the American Revolution.  Pierre Eugene DuSimitière originally suggested E pluribus unum as the motto.  When the Continental Congress approved this motto for the Great Seal in 1782, they simultaneously approved two other mottos: Annuit Coeptis (God favors our beginning) and Novus Ordo Seclorum (a new order of the ages).

In 1956, "In God We Trust" became the national motto according to United States Code, Title 36, Subtitle I, Part A, Chapter 3, Section 302.  Both mottos are imprinted on all US coinage.
