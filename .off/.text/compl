                Complexity Proves Divinity
coworker:------------------------------------------------
I know this seems like a weird question/riddle, but humor me a bit:

Suppose you were driving through the desert.  You see something colorful off the side of the road and so you stop to investigate.  Nobody is around for hundreds of miles.  You find out that there are 125 M&M's on the ground, grouped by color, 5 colors, 25 M&M's in each group, shaped in a 5x5 grid laid out in a nice square shape.  Would you assume:

1. That those M&M's became organized that way by chance over millions of years.

or

2. That somebody lined them up like that?

patware:------------------------------------------------
I would assume my god put them there.


coworker:------------------------------------------------
Put away your hate for a minute and think logically with me - please.  I would assume, as would you, that someone had placed them there.  It would be illogical to immediately assume that they had fallen together there randomly, right?



patware:------------------------------------------------
A complex structure can be created by an external force (arranged M&Ms) or by an internal force (the structure of a sunflower).

If i see a complex arrangement i would look to these as an explanation.

In the case of M&Ms i would (possibly incorrectly) guess it was done by another human.

coworker:------------------------------------------------
Whether it is a sunflower or a group of M&M's, logically it would seem that the order must have come from somewhere - had some origin.  A sunflower is much more complex than a group of M&M's so it would seem even less likely that this higher degree of complexity would just come about by random chance regardless of whether that order is internal or external.

I guess what I'm getting at is that, logically, there seems to be a discrepancy between how people view this simple example and how people in general view the similar possibilities when it comes to admitting to the existence of a God that organized this world and the variety of distinct types of plants and animals and the distinct difference between a living thing and a dead or inanimate object and how the living moves toward order and the dead or inanimate move toward chaos.

Leaving all emotion, bias, hate, and argument behind, do you see the discrepancy here?

patware:------------------------------------------------
You keep saying "came about by random chance" as though the physics of material things does not matter.  The complexity of a sunflower can be explained.  The flower didn't just fall into place.  The biological history of the earth helps us see how plants and animals have evolved.  Something as complex as the eye has been explained with regards to how cells react to light and how light reacts (can be focused for instance) to the aperature it travels through.  www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/1/l_011_01.html

There is no need for magic.  No need for hocus pocus or imaginary beings.  You claim there is a god, yet your imaginary man in the sky lies to you.  He tells you one thing, while telling the Muslims another.  He tells the televagelist (and/or his followers) yet another.  You say a person must go through an expensive building performing modified Masonic rituals in order to be 'saved', yet Catholics believe something else.  Something that god supposedly tells them (and/or their leaders).  Ask any adamant monotheistic follower if they are right.  Of course they 'know' they are on the right path.  The most successful religions are self-refferential.  They teach the adherent to uphold the lies, and in fact, even to generate reasoning and explanations for the logical troubles on the fly.  In this way, a religion sustains itself through the work of its followers by causing them to pollute their own minds.

If you were born Jewish you would likely be so today.  You claim your conversion experience is beyond reproach.  Nothing could compare.  Do you not realize persons of all faiths have had life changing 'revelations'?  You are not special.  Your hoax is no better or worse than most others.  I don't hate Mormonism too much.  There are worse religions.  But it is still monotheistic, which makes it divisive, which drives a waring mentality (we are good, they are evil).  This is great for those in charge, and has historically been important for preserving peoples against invaders (such as the US in these times).

Patriotism is approximately the same thing.  "Never question our precious leaders."  "They are right because they told me they are right!"  HA!  You sheep are allowing this world to be flushed down the toilet while claiming those which choose to follow their own heart are evil.  Homosexuals are told they are bad.  Why would 'god' make someone gay, and then call it evil?  Because there is no such thing as god.  All the bullshit that you eat is supplied by crafty old men.  People who medicate themselves instead of paying Eli Lilly are labeled terrorists.  Vicious, violent pigs like Rumsfeld and Cheney are killing in the name of peace for Military defense contracts, cleanup contracts, oil rights, etc.  They are considered righteous because you have been trained to train yourself in that direction.


Using god to explain complex situations is a time saver but it causes the original question to remain unanswered.

You say complexity proves the existience of god instead of using scientific means to investigate that complexity.

We could talk about the mechanics of cell structure, how genetic information plays a vital part in that, and how genetic information is naturally altered to vary a species - and to move it toward a life form that is most suited to the situation it finds itself in.  But i'm sure you'd rather assume Santa Clause did it.


coworker:------------------------------------------------
You're angry.  Perhaps you misunderstood - I didn't say that the

patware:------------------------------------------------
I'm angry that most of the world is being misled.  You believe nearly the same (everyone except those in your camp are being misled).  It's time to stop believing in the Tooth Fairy.  Wake up people.  There is much work to do, and it does not involve patting yourself on the back for rubbing rosary beads.

coworker:------------------------------------------------
existence of order proves that God exists; I'm just trying to look at things logically and statistically, that's all.  I do apologize for arguing with you in the past.  I'm sure that other people have probably been quite hateful toward you because of your views.  I'm not trying to prove anything, I'm just trying to look at things logically and without anger or bias and see what happens.

patware:------------------------------------------------
Nobody is hateful of my views.  They are ignorant.  You are ignorant.  You choose not to see.  Just as most of those around me.  Realizing god is a lie is scary but worth it.

coworker:------------------------------------------------
All of my experience with truth and knowledge and order (not through religion, just on my own) have taught me that when I see order somewhere, I can always trace it back to some intelligent origin. That's all I'm saying.  I have never seen something go from dust to a flower or from dust to a human or anything even remotely like that in my life - not once.  I have seen many living things create order and I have seen things die and decompose back into dust.  Isn't this your experience too?

patware:------------------------------------------------
I see plants growing from seed.  I see the complexity of chemical reactions and the formation of proteins and rudimentary life that can be used to explain the bootstrapping of the life forms on this planet.  Plants are not made from mud (as your scriptures (words written by usually well meaning old men) claim).  That is a straw man that makes it appear as though i believe such a thing.  I certainly do not.  I believe life can be explained without resorting to throwing your hands in the air and exclaiming "it's just to complex!  God must have done it!".

Let's look at it from another direction.

Assume god doesn't exist.  What problems does this cause (in your mind)?  Could the universe be explained without him/her/it(some person's gods are not human)?

coworker:------------------------------------------------

1. "assume god doesn't exist."  This goes against all of the evidence that I have experienced in my life and so I can't accept it without stronger evidence in the other direction.  What evidence is there that God doesn't exist?  There is much evidence that He does that I have experienced that evidence personally and independently of any religion or any other person.  I know that God exists as well as I know that the sun will rise tomorrow - and that is through personal experiences and evidence that are independent of any religion or other people - just me and God.  I never found that evidence until I wanted to though.  And I didn't want to find it until I realized that God wasn't defective and hateful like many people.

2. "Could the universe be explained without God?"  I can't explain it without God nor have I seen anyone else be able to explain it without resorting to assumptions and ending each sentence with "...and then after billions of years of mutations [and a little magic :)]..."  Based on the experience I have gained in my life, I can't think of any random chance explanation that would suffice at all.

I was there without any god looking and looking for a way to explain the universe.  I found out that I just didn't want to have any accountability for my actions because of my pride and hatred for myself and God and parents and so it was easier for me to just say "uh, there is no god" and it seemed to cover up the pain and anger for a while, but after several years, it became too much to bear.  My life has changed 1000% for the better and I am happier than I've ever been and all of the questions about life, existence, death, order, evolution, living things, dead things, purpose of existence, explanation of love and other emotions, the duality of my own nature, etc. have all been answered and everything makes sense and fits together beautifully.  Atheism never answered any of those questions for me - it never even began to answer any of them.  For me, it was just an escape from the anger I had inside. I'm just telling you what happened to me so you can understand where I'm coming from.

patware:------------------------------------------------
Ok, so you think i should believe in god.  Which one should i begin believing in?  One that says "Jesus is the savior of the world" (Christians), or one that says "Jesus is NOT the savior of the world" (Jewish faith)?

coworker:------------------------------------------------
That's where you go find out for yourself.  I really don't care what other people have found in life.  I have made mistakes in my life about what I thought was God or not and so I can believe that other people can make mistakes too.  What I find out about God is all that matters to me and the more pure my motives have been the more pure answer I tend to get.  The same goes for you.  Depending on the purity of your motives and the strength of your desires to find out, you can know what is true.

This is what I have found in my own life and I have studied other religions and found a lot of truth in them that has helped me but I have also found the flaws and fears of men riddled through them and I see how people can be wrong - just as I was wrong - and just as I am not completely right yet!  I don't know it all (not even close) but I do know a few basics as confidently as I know the sun will rise tomorrow:

(These are not just things that people have told me nor are they
regurgitated factoids - each one was gained through trial and specific
experience)

1. God exists, is our spiritual father, is perfect, and loves each of us
2. Christ is the Son of God and His sacrifice proves to us that God loves us
3. The Book of Mormon contains the words of God as does the Bible
4. Joseph Smith was a prophet of God
5. I'm pretty sure that Gordon B. Hinckley is a prophet, but not as certain as the rest of these items.  I'm currently working on this one.

If you sincerely want to know if God exists or not, I'd be glad to help you out with any questions you have.  If not, that's fine too - I enjoy bouncing ideas off of you even though it ticks you off sometimes - sorry.  :)
