The term 'open' is sometimes used by those opposed to true freedom to describe a 'free' market unfettered by moral baggage.

"Open Source" is an example - where "Free Software" is the supposed morally superior path even though the sets described are nearly identical.

The 'fair' is similar in this respect

The George Soros "Open Society" is another example.  Why not make a "Free Society"?  No profit in that.
