"'The Creative Commons Education License is a partnership with the Creative Commons project at Stanford Law School, in which we are working to create a specialized Creative Commons license that speaks clearly to educators, answers their questions, and helps them feel secure in moving from the traditional "All Rights Reserved" model of restricting access to their educational content to a more open "Some Rights Reserved" model.'" -- http://cosl.usu.edu/projects/cc-edu
