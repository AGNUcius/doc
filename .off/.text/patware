My first given name was Jerome Windsor.

I was adopted from San Mateo, CA USA at birth and named Patrick Todd Anderson.

I grew up in Monteview, Idaho and went on a mission to Iowa for the Mormon church.

I am living spirit within a beast genetically similar to an ape.

My organism tends to worship the sun, hoard resources, dominate, and reproduce.

My main occupation is the realization of Coopolis.

I'm sponsoring a sustainability contest called Ecocomics.

My Emacs configuration files are called NoteMacs.
