"'From the Roman Latifundi "Great Estates", identified as the ultimate cause of the collapse of the Roman Empire, these were immense private estates in Italy farmed by slaves and owned by the senators and wealthy citizens of Rome, which consumed far more than they produced, and shut out the majority of the populace from access to land on which to live, farm or otherwise work for a living, leading to great discontent, unemployment, poverty and lack of loyalty to the system of government in Rome itself. Only the rich had any interest in maintaining things as they were.'" -- www.geocities.com/RainForest/3046/calif.htm
