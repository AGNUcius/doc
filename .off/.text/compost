Organic matter changes state.

Some organisms pull high concentrations of minerals and metals from soil.

You may mine in this way - by raising, harvesting and drying and burning plants or fungus to retreive the skeletal dust.

Consuming can be dangerous if this is not transformed.


Composting is an aerobic operation, which means the bacteria need some air.  Accomplish this by mixing `green' (low fiber: plant kitchen scraps, ) with `brown' (high fiber: leaves, straw, chaff).

This is difficult without the proper tools...

A wood snipper would help.
And a way to turn the mess.
