Yes, but that is only possible when all of the Sources of Production are available "at cost" to any qualified renter to bid, and the qualified consumer always has first choice in doing their own work, and qualification depends nothing upon someone liking someone else, or charity, or so-called morals.

The end of all work need not be consumption, it might be just for the fun of it, or to "show off", for insurance or in some cases humans are misled enough to pay others to be allowed (far above cost) access to machines with which to work-out (at the gym) so both time AND energy are being idled away instead of being put to productive use.  I will store some coconuts for later use, and perhaps to help you out if you end up in the gutter after drinking all of yours as coconut wine. :|

I am describing a way to share so that specialization is retained.  These communities will eventually purchase the most expensive of productive tools - so that the creation of computers, TVs, yard equipment, appliances, etc. will be as local as possible.

But since most of us won't usually want to pick our own fruit, we only need to purchase Land, Water, Trees and Tools, then make them available for any qualified worker to bid upon.  I want to begin doing this as soon as possible, even though the General Public Lease is not quite finished, but I have not become incorporated, and don't yet have the PR skills to present a business-like atmosphere that people expect from an employer or rental agency.  Will anyone here help me begin this incremental solution?

Stakeholders will want to protect their investments from vandals and fools, while the GPL will ensure they are otherwise as free as possible.

Every potential worker must pre-qualify for any tool use, but some rentals have very low requirements.

Requirements might include:

Renter must have X insurance points deposited.  These can be accumulated by working a zero-risk job such as shoveling compost.

If the machine is very expensive and easy to damage the shareholders may require you pass an automated test or maybe even require you hire a 'certifier' who has Y insurance points.  Once certified in this way, you must also pass proof of current qualification - so that you may not bid if you are too drunk or tired.
Machines that could hurt you or someone else (such as an X-ray machine or a backhoe) must have warning labels attached, and it must be clear in the Lease that the shareholders hold not responsibility for any damages done.  If a "sign your life away" document - such is used in sky-diving - is what it takes, then so be it.  We want to be fair, and don't want anyone to get hurt, but must take legal measures to protect ourselves.  Rental agencies and employers already do this to a degree.

There are no dividend checks.  All the money that the renters pay is owned collectively and automatically earmarked to its application.

The rent 'floor' comprises all real costs of renting that equipment.  Any bid above the 'floor' is applied toward purchasing more of that kind of equipment.

I doubt it is similar, though I don't feel like spending time to find out what the corporations were really trying to accomplish through him.

In a GNU system only workers get paid, and only if they are able to find a consumer, or hire someone to find consumers for them.  Managers are also a kind of worker, and may also sell to consumers while hiring employees 'underneath' them as is the usual case, but at each rent-cycle (each time the machines are again up for bid), the manager must worry that the artisans (skilled workers) might loose interest in being employees under his umbrella because they will now be able to underbid him so they may access the machines (sources) directly.  After a few iterations we will find artisans hiring managers back, but usually at a smaller salary, and reducing that salary or even laying them off when once the artisan has enough understanding of the business to do without parental oversight.

Eventually consumers will mostly only pay independent artisans (skilled workers), but to begin with the skills of HR and management will be needed to organize the complexities of finding skilled workers to work together.

Imagine some consumers desire a walking path lined with incense and peppermint, nut trees and grape vines.  They write a list of requirements that must be met within a certain timeframe.

Purchasing in this manner is an implicit vote toward that goal.  Pre-payment allows the most weight in steering and planning, and will help fund the purchase of the irrigation equipment, tillers, seed, planting and harvesting tools that the independent artisans will rent "at cost".

Some managers will be able to hire employees to work for him during the time that he is renting equipment, but those employees are free at each rent cycle to suddenly bid against their own boss.  It will be survival of the fittest because managerial types will never again be able to hide from the laws of efficiency.

But how would the usurists then steal their value?  You tell me that "owner profit" (usury) is the only motivator.  Who would become educated in medicine and technology if they were only going to be paid for working?

My answer: those who will work for the wage a customer is willing to pay within a system where sources are "at cost" without the ability to extract more than that by holding sources artificially scarce - it is those humans who likely most qualify for those positions anyway.  Usurists (those who plan to derive through there-firstedness and artificial scarcity) will be as dumbfounded as Microsoft and Oracle are about how to adjust their business models to face the threat of freedom from the GPL.

The lazy slobs are the very rich that have figured out ways to parasitically live off of the work of others.  If they don't change their ways they shall die.

But if you are talking about the poor, well that is a different story.  Today it is usually the very youngest and hardest of workers that finally starve.  These most valuable humans will be the only winners when resources are finally Free as in Freedom.  Usurist shall return to the dust unless they change their ways.

The city which I will be Mayor of will follow the spirit of Henry George's vision with regards to all finite resources AND to many Capital resources.
The streets and city center will be packed with the plants and animals every human needs for food, medicine, soap, cloth, paper and building materials.  It will also contain thousands of machines that can be rented by any qualified artisan to become almost instantly wealthy enough to live.

The Mayor of Calcutta was not using the GNU Mode of Production I describe, so there is no interest in comparing us.

You continue to mix 'poor' with 'lazy'.  The few poor people that are now finally lazy would not have become so if their previous attempts at making a simple living had paid off in the way any honest person would have expected them to.  But when that fails, and when they are tricked into massive debt but still don't harden their hearts in a way that a business man must do to begin exploiting his own brethren, then they give up because of the futility of it all, and with steril cities they don't even have an opportunity to rent an apple tree to eat a few apples and pay that rent by bringing some apples to the storehouse.

To claim that the poor have the ability to exploit "soft hearts" is entertaining.  It is not the poor who exploit, it is the corporations that feed on the terrible conditions; using them as an excuse to take more freedom and money in the name of saving us from ourselves instead devising ways to allow us to keep what we make and pay for all we take.

Are you telling me that if just the two of us were on an island you would want to somehow require me to add some of my coconuts to the community store instead of being allowed to hold my insurance private?  I agree aggregate insurance can be useful, but you are talking about not letting make that decision.  How would you force me to add my coconuts to the shared storage?

When I said THEY I meant "each individual".  I have no obligation to anyone else except to allow them "at cost" access to the means of production so I cannot impose usury (Usury comes in 3 forms: Interest, Profit, or Rent).

Because if I don't stop these profiteering feudalists they will eventually hire vassals to come take all of MY resources to stop MY production.  That is the penultimate problem with allowing any form of usury: it finally creates war.

You WILL become a member because I will outperform you if you are trying to be a usurist, and you will retain more value if you are willing to work.

So the Sources of Production (such as Land, Water, Seed, Tools) that they need to organically exist are available to them without paying tribute to a parasitic Liege usurist.

When profit comes from owning instead of from working it is USURY, not USERY.  A portion of profit, interest and rent are initially meaningful and useful in reclaiming the labor expended or resources lent, but they are almost universally taken to far, and at the instant that an owner is paid just because they we "There First(TM)", they are a usurist.  Jesus cries.

Nehemiah 5:10  "I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury."

Many humans have incentive to work without the goal of eventually exploiting others, only expecting to get paid for the work they do.  But after they begin hiring employees, and as the business grows they see there is much to be made by hoarding.  We must eliminate those externalizing actions before the beast destroys the entire earth in the name of "owner profit" (usury).

Public?  As in: The 'state' chooses how my rent is applied without my consent?  Are saying I don't have a choice, that you are going to be studying brain surgery on your half of the island, and I must pay you by gathering all the coconuts myself?  Good luck.  If I care about what you are studying I may *choose* to help you continue, but if you try to force me I guarantee I will refuse, even if just to spite you attempting to be my guardian.

But there is a new, third Mode of Production that you dismiss because it is so new and really not even yet fully discovered.  It is a contract enforced "at cost" syndication through private ownership that bypasses top heavy government and corporate stupidity.

Even non-profit hospitals (for instance, IHC here in Utah) are just another way for fat-cats to occasionally sit on a committee room to gather their quarter of a million salary while devising ways to keep the consumer and workers  from accessing the equipment "at cost".  Non-profit is not the same as Free as in Freedom.  Non-profit is nearly the same as any usurous corporation, but with the thievery more cleverly disguised.

Most people will choose to not do specialed work themselves, but they must be allowed to make that choice.  It is the allowance of choice that will create nearly perfect competition and drive costs to their absolute minimum.  We are erroneously taught that costs must remain high so usury can be gathered, but on an island it is easy to see we want everything as free as can be.

Nobody need be 'assigned' any position.  The point I'm failing to make is that access to the equipment can be disconnected from the original owners so that all qualified artisans may specialize in whatever field they choose without every suffering a penny of usurous theft from profiteers, and consumers may always choose to do the work themselves if they qualify (in skill, insurance, sanitation, etc.).

That is correct just so the trustees could never take away the freedom of others to access those resources "at cost", and just so the wages of the trustees and the fatness of the board is always being pared by the consumer and workers who are trying to keep the rental floor as low as possible while ensuring the machines and buildings are maintained.

The owner might be a private individual or it may be jointly owned - it does not matter, just so the Lease is enforcable in perpetuity.  The owner is important only in syndicating that property within the current system.

It might make sense to incrementally spread that 'real' ownership across those who rent the resource, so that those who have the most stake in it eventually become the joint legal holders, and so the death of the original purchaser does not effect the community.

Because we haven't yet written a Lease that disallows owners from collecting profit and and incentive system that minimizes costs - so that so-called managers find it very difficult to receive any pay whatsoever if they are not performing a vital service that cannot be more efficiently performed by someone else who bids a lower amount to achieve the same effect.

Once the Lease is written a community will have a legal device to enforce righteous access to all Sources of Production, but before then it is just an administrative money pit designed by those who want to engorge the organization to pad themselves from loosing their posh employment.

If the really have the freedom as describe, then the only ones that will die will be those who *REFUSE* to work.  Even the lowest of skilled will easily make enough to live, as the most vital of all employment is that of bringing back the abundance of nature as describe by the Garden of Eden, and much (not all) of that work requires only muscle.

What behavior do you mean?  Are you saying I must put some of my coconuts in shared storage so you may draw from them if you are too lazy to do your own work?  Sorry, but I'm not interested in protecting you from yourself.

This makes me think you mis-wrote your previous statement:

I do not think I will become a member of your

I don't know very much about Marx, but whenever I say that usurous owners shouldn't be allowed to steal value from workers, that name is hurled at me as though a curse.

But these trusts must be willing to sing a contract (such as a Lease) that disallows hoarding and structures incentives to keep the top (so-called managers or committee members) as light as possible, and eventually only consumers have any say at all as they implicitly vote by purchasing.

The actual owners are not important except in protecting the investment from the predatory feudalists through contract enforced syndication.  A single person could hold an entire town and all the machines without it making a difference to the workers and consumers because the contract (probably a Lease) explicitly stops them from performing that ancient evil = USURY.
