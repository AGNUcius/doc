Swaraj through Swadeshi.


"'Swaraj (Self-rule) is my birthright, and I shall have it!'" -- Bal Gangadhar Tilak


"'I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man [woman] whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him [her]. Will he [she] gain anything by it? Will it restore him [her] to a control over his [her] own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to swaraj [freedom] for the hungry and spiritually starving millions?
Then you will find your doubts and your self melt away.'" -- Mahatma Gandhi [Last Phase, Vol. II (1958), P. 65].
