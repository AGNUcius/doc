BitCoin.org >>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network based anonymous digital currency. Peer-to-peer (P2P) means that there is no central authority to issue new money or keep track of transactions. Instead, these tasks are managed collectively by the nodes of the network. Anonymity means that the real world identity of the parties of a transaction can be kept hidden from the public or even from the parties themselves.

"'If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.'" -- Thomas Jefferson

"'Give me control of a nation's money, and I care not who writes it's laws...'" -- Meyer Armschel Rothschild 1790

"'If you want to be the slaves of banks and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let the banks create money...'" -- Josiah Stamp, Governor of the Bank of England 1920

"'Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.'" -- President James A. Garfield

"'If our Nation can issue a dollar bond, it can issue a dollar bill.  The element that makes the bond good also makes the bill good.  The difference between the bond and the bill lets money brokers [bankers] collect twice the amount of the bond plus interest.  Whereas the bill [currency] pays nobody but those who contribute directly in some useful way.  The People are the basis for government credit.  Why then cannot the People have the benefit of their own credit by receiving non-interest bearing currency, instead of bankers receiving the People's credit in interest bearing bonds?  It is absurd to say that our country can issue 30 million dollars in bonds and not 30 million dollars in currency!  Both are promises to pay; but one promise fattens the usurers and the other helps the People!'" -- Thomas Edison

Money is any good or token used by a society as a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account.

US Federal Reserve Notes are not Money because they are backed only by a "promise to pay".


Direct barter is inefficient because it requires traders have simultaneous coincidence of wants.

Sun Book (Holy Bible):
Exodus 7:12 >>And they every one cast down their rods, and they were turned into serpents: but Aaron's rod devoured their rods.
Numbers 21:9 >>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.


While it is legal for any community to issue it's own currency, the US Government chooses to not do that.  Because of a meeting on an island named Jekyll, the American people pay enormous interest payments to a collection of Private Bankers just for the fact that we decide to have currency in circulation.

The US government has decided to rent the right to issue currency (US Federal Reserve Notes) from the list of Private Bankers that comprise the Federal Reserve. This extremely bad situation has US paying interest on every Dollar in issue. We US citizens are paying a Rent to Private Bankers for the otherwise inalienable right of a community to create and issue it's own currency. I believe this is against the US Constitution?

International Bankers "make money" for most nations caught in their spell - when they reproduce yet more of the local currency which the IMF and World Bank use to endebt the natives.

Wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation >>1. The government issues a Treasury security. This is simply an IOU, a promise to pay the holder a specified sum of money on a particular date. In this example, let's say the government issues $1,000,000 worth of bonds.  Individual investors, pension funds, mutual funds, insurance agencies, banks, foreign government central banks, can all buy the bonds, effectively loaning money to the treasury. They do this to invest their money and receive interest in return.
