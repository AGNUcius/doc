The Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware.  EFI is intended as a significantly improved replacement of the old legacy BIOS firmware interface historically used by all IBM PC-compatible personal computers.  The EFI specification was originally developed by Intel, and is now managed by the Unified EFI Forum and is officially known as Unified EFI (UEFI).
