    shrink      = There are two ways to shrink a volume using this tool.
                  One way is to shrink the volume as part of a dismount
                  operation using the optional [s]hrink parameter.
                  Shrinking during dismount does not require administrative
                  privileges, and therefore does not involve UAC dialogs.
                  Shrinking using the s<h>rinkVolume command does require
                  administrative privileges.  For practical purposes
                  it's generally best to simply use [s]hrink as part of
                  a dismount command.  Limitations: Shrink will only work
                  under Windows Vista/2008+ against a writeable mount of
                  a backup image that contains an NTFS file system.
                  The shrink performed by either of these options is a
                  truncation shrink - it will shrink the file system so
                  that its new size extends to the last allocated cluster.
