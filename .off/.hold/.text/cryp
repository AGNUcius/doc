These disks operate exactly like a normal disk, with the exception that anything written to one of them is transparently, and securely, encrypted before being stored on your computer's hard drive.

MCrypt.sf.net >>MCrypt is a replacement for the old crypt() package and crypt(1) command, with extensions. It allows developers to use a wide range of encryption functions, without making drastic changes to their code. It allows users to encrypt files or data streams without having to be cryptographers. Above all, it allows you to have some really neat code on your machine. :)

MCrypt Functions implemented:

Algorithm	Encumbered	Block Size	Key Type	Notes
3-Way	No	96	Secret
Arcfour	Probably not	Stream	Secret	Name is derived from "Alternative RC4". It is a mathematical clone of RC4, apparently to bypass the IP limitations of the original formulation. Arcfour is usually treated as unencumbered, and seems safe to regard as such, in general. IP interpretations at a given time or place may be different. If it is reclassed as encumbered, it will be removed from the main code.
Blowfish	No	64	Secret
Cast	No	64	Secret
DES	No	64	Secret
Enigma	No	Stream	Secret
Gost	No	64	Secret
Idea	No	64	Secret
RC2	No	64	Secret
RC6	Yes	128	Secret
Loki	No	128	Secret
Mars	Yes	128	Secret
Panama	No	Stream	Secret	Fails Test
Rijndael	No	128, 192, 256	Secret	AES if used in 128-bit mode
Safer	No	64	Secret
Safer+	No		Secret
Serpent	No	Block	Secret
Skipjack	Doubtful	64	Secret	External module. Written by NSA for Clipper chip. Origins are murky.
