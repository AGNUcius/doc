Finite resources constrain economic actors.

A truely finite thing cannot be reproduced and may be polluted or destroyed.  All other things are composed of one or more finite things.  This means all things are finite in some way.

Sun, air, water, soil, radio spectrum, time

Some finite things may be able to reproduce a copy of themselves, but the potential for a species or for software is destroyed if the final copy of that type is deleted.

  The DNA of wheat, tomatoes and herbs in a plate of spaghetti.

  The surface area of usable land, the volume of space and sunlight.

Other resources are temporarily finite because of the cost of copying:

  'Instances' or 'copies' of finite resources are:
     Organisms, Buildings, Tools, Data, software, design

  The particular pieces of DNA that happen to be in this plate of spaghetti.

Unbridled privatization of finite resources allows owners dominion over more than their fair share.  The holding can be so large that there no longer seems to be enough.  The owners then typically use artificial scarcity to create slavery and profit.


Finite resources include:
  Land : Surface area of the earth and soil
  Space: Sun and Wind considerations for buildings and trees.
  Air  : Pollution, spraying
  Water:
  Soil : minerals, salts, metals, silver, diamond, petrol
  Genes: The DNA of plants, animals or fungus
  Info : Optimal designs and solutions are finite in number.
  Pollution capacity: There's less of this than ever.
  Physics: radio frequencies, IP addresses [namestead.com]
