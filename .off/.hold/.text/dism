:: This post is part of our "How-To's" section and covers Windows PE 3.0 which is most commonly used by those that repair computers or install Windows in enterprise environments.  This post may be expanded on in the future to help those that frequently work with Windows PE.

:: This is a list of commands for the new Windows PE 3.0 based on Windows 7.  There have been many changes to PE including the addition of a new application called DISM.exe or the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool.  ImageX can still be used for some commands such as mounting and unmounting the wim and more importantly compressing the wim.  DISM does normal compression by default but does not have an option for you to change the compression level (that I am aware of).

:: At the time of writing this Windows PE 3.0 is still in the beta phase but is more than stable for typical usage.  To create Windows PE you need to download and install the Windows Automated Installation Kit or WAIK.  You can get this from Microsoft.

:: To start create a directory in "C:\" called "PE" so that it looks like "C:\PE"

:: You can then create batch files from the following commands by simply copying the text and pasting it into a notepad document then saving it according to the format "MountWIM.bat ".  An important note with these commands is they must be executed as an administrator.  If you are on either Windows Vista or Windows 7 you either have to elevate a command prompt or create batch files and then right click the file and select "Run as administrator".

:: Create winpe_x86 directory in C:\PE (this WILL delete it if the directory already exists):

rd /s/q C:\PE\winpe_x86

cd "c:\Program files\windows aik\tools\petools"
call copype.cmd x86 C:\PE\winpe_x86

:: Mount the WIM image:

cd "C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\x86\Servicing"
DISM.exe /Mount-Wim /WimFile:C:\PE\winpe_x86\ISO\sources\boot.wim /index:1 /MountDir:C:\PE\winpe_x86\mount

:: UnMount the WIM image commiting changes:

cd "C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\x86\Servicing"
DISM.exe /unmount-Wim /MountDir:C:\PE\winpe_x86\mount /Commit

Add packages into your WIM, this can be edited to only add in what you need to reduce the size of the WIM:

cd "C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\x86\Servicing\"
dism /image:C:\PE\winpe_x86\mount /Add-Package /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\PETools\x86\WinPE_OCs\winpe.cab"
dism /image:C:\PE\winpe_x86\mount /Add-Package /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\PETools\x86\WinPE_OCs\winpe-wmi.cab"
dism /image:C:\PE\winpe_x86\mount /Add-Package /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\PETools\x86\WinPE_OCs\winpe-hta.cab"
dism /image:C:\PE\winpe_x86\mount /Add-Package /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\PETools\x86\WinPE_OCs\winpe-legacysetup.cab"
dism /image:C:\PE\winpe_x86\mount /Add-Package /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\PETools\x86\WinPE_OCs\winpe-mdac.cab"
dism /image:C:\PE\winpe_x86\mount /Add-Package /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\PETools\x86\WinPE_OCs\winpe-scripting.cab"
dism /image:C:\PE\winpe_x86\mount /Add-Package /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\PETools\x86\WinPE_OCs\winpe-setup.cab"
dism /image:C:\PE\winpe_x86\mount /Add-Package /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\PETools\x86\WinPE_OCs\winpe-wds-tools.cab"

:: Check what packages are installed:

cd "C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\x86\Servicing\"
dism /image:c:\PE\winpe_x86\mount\ /Get-Packages

:: UnMount the WIM image discarding changes:

cd "C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\x86\Servicing"
DISM.exe /unmount-Wim /MountDir:C:\PE\winpe_x86\mount /discard

:: Create Windows PE ISO:

cd "C:\Program Files\Windows AIK\Tools\x86?
oscdimg -n -bc:\PE\winpe_x86\etfsboot.com c:\PE\winpe_x86\ISO c:\PE\winpe_x86\winpe_x86.iso

You need to run this from the command prompt as Adminstrator

DISM.exe /Get-Wiminfo /WimFile:C:\Sources\install.wim
# Gives you information and editions present in the install.wim#

DISM.exe /Mount-Wim /WimFile:C:\Sources\install.wim /index:3 /MountDir:C:\Mount
# Mount's the specified edition of Windows 7 in this case 3 which Pro, 4 is Ultimate and so on...#

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Add-Driver:C:\Drivers /recurse
# Will add all the drivers from the folder Drivers in the C drive including subfolders#

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Get-Drivers > C:\Log\Drivers.txt
# Will dump all the installed drivers successful or not in the Drivers.txt file#

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Add-Package:C:\Updates
# Will install all the updates(.msu packages) from the updates folder#

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Get-Features | more
# Will list all the features installed in the mounted version of the OS#

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Get-Features > C:\Log\Features.txt
# Will list all the features installed in the mounted version of the OS in the Features.txt file#

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:
# By going through the above command/ or the Features.txt you can find the status of the installed features enabled or disabled. Now I have till now never used the Windows Media Center and think I have no use for it, also the Internet Printing so in this example I will show you have to disable them#

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:MediaCenter

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:TabletPCOC

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:Printing-Foundation-Features

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:Printing-Foundation-InternetPrinting-Client

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:FaxServicesClientPackage

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Get-Features > C:\Log\FeaturesD.txt
# Running this again to figure out what was disabled#

You might want to enable some features like the Telnet client to telnet or for troubleshooting purpose

DISM.exe /Image:C:\Mount /Enable-Feature:TelnetClient
# This will enable the Telnet Client, you can do so for the Telnet Server as well but not recommended and is a security risk on the Internet#

Time to save all the hard work

DISM.exe /Unmount-Wim /MountDir:C:\Mount /commit
# Trust me this will look like it is not working, but it takes approximately more than 30-45 minutes to complete, might take longer too...#

Once is gives you the completed successfully message you can again copy the install.wim in to your Windows 7 DVD and the install it

How do you make it bootable, if you have WAIK installed you can use the oscdimg.exe using the following command

-b"C:\GRMCULXFRER_EN_DVD\boot\etfsboot.com" -h -u2 -m -lGRMCULXFRER_EN_DVD 
"C:\GRMCULXFRER_EN_DVD" "E:\GRMCULXFRER_EN_DVD.iso"
