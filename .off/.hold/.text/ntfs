ADSCheck.sf.net >>is a security tool for Windows® NTFS 4/5.x (2000, XP and Server 2003) designed to check for the presense of Alternate Data Streams which --- with their current implementation --- represent a security risk offering crackers a good means to hide their gear in the victim system. ADSCheck can also extract ADS for later examination and/or delete them. It generates a tab-delimited text report in unicode, thereby making it easy to examine it using a database application. There are also verbose and quiet switches to tweak its operation to user's needs.

Forensic-Analysis-NTFS-File-System.GoogleCode.com >>Persistent attacks may try to camouflage their intentions by changing time stamps and file attributes, of installed or modified files to make them appear as legitimate programs. Goal of this practicum is to develop a tool which will analyze the low level details of file system which might not be easy for an attacker to modify, so that we can distinguish between legitimate files and malicious files based on their creation date, file modifications timestamps and modifications to timestamp. There is much more information which we can trace back, that will give insight about the anomaly behavior of a malicious program, for example if an attacker intentionally tries to modify implicit attributes of a file such as timestamps, or tries to hide files in Alternate Data Streams
