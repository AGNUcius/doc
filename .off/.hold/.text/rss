infoRSS.MozDev.org >>infoRSS is a lightweight, non intrusive, RSS, ATOM, NNTP and HTML headlines reader for Firefox, Mozilla, Netscape and thunderbird, designed by Didier Ernotte. The extension installs a small icon (looks like an earth) in the status bar. The headlines are displayed in the beside this icon in the status bar or in a separate bar (top or bottom of the screen). The interface is very simple to use: drag and drop new url of feed onto the extension icon to add a new feed or click on the extension icon to select a specific feed to read. The feeds can be grouped to allow multi feed fetch and filter can be used to limit the number of headlines.
