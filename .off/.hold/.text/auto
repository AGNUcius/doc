ContRap.sf.net >>ContRap is a free multi-platform control flow based rapid prototyping toolkit. The project presents a complete plugin-based framework to rapidly develop complex program prototypes.  The prototypes are combined of atomic components, called plugins. The interaction between the plugins, i.e. the data flow and the control flow, is specified by ContRap scripts.
