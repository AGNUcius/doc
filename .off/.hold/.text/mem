VolatileSystems.com/default/volatility >>The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools, implemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples. The extraction techniques are performed completely independent of the system being investigated but offer unprecedented visibilty into the runtime state of the system. The framework is intended to introduce people to the techniques and complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts from volatile memory samples and provide a platform for further work into this exciting area of research.

Hoard.org >>The Hoard memory allocator is a fast, scalable, and memory-efficient memory allocator.  It runs on a variety of platforms, including Linux, Solaris, and Windows.  Hoard is a drop-in replacement for malloc() that can dramatically improve application performance, especially for multithreaded programs running on multiprocessors.  No change to your source is necessary.  Just link it in or set just one environment variable.
