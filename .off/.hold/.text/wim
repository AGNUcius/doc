Windows Imaging Format (WIM)

Wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Imaging_Format >>Like other disk image formats, a WIM file contains a set of files and associated filesystem metadata. However, unlike sector-based formats (such as .ISO, .CUE/.BIN used for CD and DVD images), WIM is file-based, which means that the smallest unit of information is a file. The primary advantages of it being file-based include hardware independence and unique storage of a file referenced multiple times in the filesystem tree (single instance storage).

With Pkgmgr, boot-critical device drivers are added to Windows before installation.

Code.MSDN.Microsoft.com/InstallWindowsImage >>The Install-WindowsImage PowerShell script uses the wimgapi.dll in Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 to apply a Windows image in a .wim file to a specified location. The script can be used to apply a Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 .wim image to a Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) used for native VHD boot or to boot in a Hyper-V virtual machine. The Using Install-WindowsImage document provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how to create a VHD in Windows 7 and use Install-WindowsImage to apply an image for native boot. The document is available on the Downloads tab in Microsoft Office Word 2007 (.docx) or Protable Documentation Format (.pdf). A related tool, WIM2VHD, is available from the MSDN Code Gallery that automates the steps of VHD creation and applying a .wim image using the Imagex deployment tool from the Windows Automated Installation Kit (AIK).
