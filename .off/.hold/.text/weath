Weather is like the health of nature.

This program uses weather data supplied by the Weather::Underground module to create an ASCII animation that simulates the weather.  There is also a large number of random creatures and objects that walk across this screen.  As of version 1.7, I've begun adding seasonal/holiday objects.


> Bastards were spraying heavily last night & today in LA.  Anyone else notice?  I'm so sluggish and sick!  Look up.  It's for real.

AGNUcius responds:
I think the lower flying prop planes might be taking light readings, then the equipment radios the findings to the higher altitude tankers.  It makes me want to shoot them out of the sky, but after all, they are just doing their jobs right?  Vassals paid with our tax dollars.

Some have suggested this is part of the reason the honey bees and bumble bees are dying.  The US bee population has been falling for several years now at an increasing rate.  It has reduced approx 40% since 2006.  Others wonder if GMO plants are troubling the insects.  Nut and fruit prices will be much higher in the coming years because of this.  Notice how that is great for profit.  BTW: Wheat and corn prices are also climbing, and are expected to continue.

I also wonder if the spraying has to do with the distribution of Morgellons as artificially constructed lifeforms.  See SilentSuperBug-Reference.BlogSpot.com and SilentSuperBug.com

On the other hand, they (notice WE are not the THEY) have some laws that make this technically 'legal', so if you were to ever try to rally against it, you really don't have a leg to stand on, as the argument would be "well, you should have contacted your congress-person when the bill was still pending" as though the common citizen/consumer should be required to continuously defend themselves against poisons.  Well, look on the labels of your food.  It is also full of nasty shite.  WE (the real people) must OWN the means of production so we can begin to make a stand against this filth.  As it is, we are actually paying for this treachery through not only tax (and delayed tax as currency issuance), but also whenever we buy products that support the corporations that actually run the governments.
