Vamps.sf.net >>Vamps was written to make cheap backups of DVDs under Linux. Back in 2003 Metakine published the source code of their M2Requantiser module. The idea was to make use of this great piece of software to create a transcoder for Linux for shrinking the content of a DVD9. This would enable backups on cheap single layer DVDRs (double layer burners weren't even available that time). The Metakine requantizer is pretty fast and so Vamps was designed not to break this outstanding performance.
