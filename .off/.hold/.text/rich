    The 2 Roads to Riches

The much larger trail is paved with gold and lit by electric diamond lamps.  Silver fences hold cameras and gates.  Great signs advertise how to win your fortune by increasing the scarcity of others.


The other way is a meandering mess.  It is not clearly marked and appears to allow almost any path.  Fences are mostly made of berry bushes but seem to be only to contain the animals, as the gates are always locked open but latched.  Ad-hoc signs show little continuity and often seem sarcastic or are too confusing to even understand.  For instance, one sign reads:

Towering pinyon pines shade ponds filled with annoying ducks and geese.  The smell cattle and sounds of chickens pollute the air.
