E=mc^2 -> Energy=Mass*Light^2

Storage idea:
  Windmill, waterwheel, solar steam engine, etc. raises massive weight (a sled of rock suspended by a cable) to store energy while production/collection exceeds need.  Later, weight drives generator when need exceeds production.  A battery bank buffers the transition.  The weight travels within a vertical underground shaft for increased saftey and ease of construction.

Wire house with high capacity, cleaned 12 volt DC and universal plugs to power computers, car equipment, cameras, cell phones, etc.
