"'OpenOffice.org can convert any of its files including PowerPoint files into Flash files. It's free and has great tool for direct conversion of PowerPoint files to .swf files. You only have to import PowerPoint file to OpenOffice and then export presentation to .swf file. Transitions and animations are not supported.'" -- http://www.stanford.edu/~kwillis/blog/archives/2006/04/openofficeorg_c.html

"'Here I have been using OpenOffice for the last two years and I didn't know that you could export a PowerPoint file (or a native OOo Presentation file) from OpenOffice to Macromedia Flash format. The last time I had to send pre-conference slides, I exported them as an Adobe PDF, which worked well. Now I can save slides in Flash format, and they can be read by any web browser. My test file was a 2.5 MB PowerPoint file, which was the same size in OpenOffice Presenter. When I converted it to Flash (.swf), the file was compressed to 360 KB.'" -- http://www.jarche.com/?p=370
