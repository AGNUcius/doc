Wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics) >>In general, the economic value of something is how much a product or service is worth to someone relative to other things (often measured in money).[citation needed]

Wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_value_(economics) >>"Theory of value" is a generic term which encompasses all the theories within economics that explain the exchange value or price of goods and services. Key question in economic theory include why goods and services are priced as they are, how the value of goods and services comes about, and for normative value theories how to calculate the correct price of goods and services (if such a value exists).


Wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value
"'In Marx's critique of political economy, any labor-product has a value and a use value, and if it is traded as a commodity in markets, it additionally has an exchange value, most often expressed as a money-price.

These four concepts (value, use value, exchange value and price) have a very long history in economic and philosophical thought, from Aristotle to Adam Smith, and their meanings evolved. Marx comments for example that "in English writers of the 17th century we frequently find worth in the sense of value in use, and value in the sense of exchange-value." With the expansion of market economy, however, the focus of economists has increasingly been on prices and price-relations, the social process of exchange as such being assumed to occur as a naturally given fact.'"


Wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value >>The labor theory of value (LTV) is a theory in economics according to which the true value of commodities is related to the labor needed to produce them.    Cost of production is the next best alternative forgone. In economics, the cost-of-production theory of value is the theory that the price of an object is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it.  The cost can be composed of the cost of any of the factors of production including labour, taxation, capital, land, or technology.'"


Wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_value >>The law of value is a concept in Karl Marx's critique of political economy.  Most generally, it refers to a regulative principle of the economic exchange of the products of human work: the relative exchange-values of those products in trade, usually expressed by money-prices, are proportional to the average amounts of human labour-time which are currently socially necessary to produce them.
