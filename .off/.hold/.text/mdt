The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit 2008 Update 1 does all this and more. And it's free too! MDT 2008 will also solve a number other problems you might have.

MDT 2008 includes a mmc console, a customised WinPE build environment and many very useful scripts. From it's 'imagex' wrapper gui it can (via lite touch or zero touch, smb share, pxeboot or media):

   1. Inject new drivers
   2. Change the HAL
   3. Input a PC name and join the machine to a domain.
   4. Change the timezone and language details
   5. Change the local admin password
   6. Running Windows update (including running it against your own WSUS server)
   7. Install additional programs.

MDT 2008 can also:

   1. Inject new mass storage drivers
   2. Automate imagex build and captures
   3. Change customise deployments based on data inputted into database.
   4. Customise WinPE images
   5. Tons more that I'll get to listing.
