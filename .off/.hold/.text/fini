Finite resources constrain economic actors.

A truely finite thing cannot be reproduced and may be polluted or deleted.  All other things are composed of one or more finite things.  This means all things are finite in some way.

Some finite things may be able to reproduce a copy of themselves, but an entire species or program may be irreversibly deleted if the final copy is destroyed:

  Sun, Air, Water, Land (both area and soil), specific genetic lines, fossil fuels, radio frequencies, time

  The wheat variety or 'Type' of DNA for a plate of spaghetti.


Other resources are temporarily finite because of the cost of copying:

  'Instances' or 'copies' of finite resources are:
     Organisms, Buildings, Tools, Data, software, design

  The particular pieces of DNA that happen to be in this plate of spaghetti.

Unbridled privatization of finite resources allows owners dominion over more than their fair share.  The holding can be so large that there no longer seems to be enough.  The owners then typically use artificial scarcity to create slavery and profit.


Finite resources include:
  Land : Surface area of the earth and soil
  Space: Sun and Wind considerations for buildings and trees.
  Air  : Pollution, spraying
  Water:
  Soil : minerals, salts, metals, silver, diamond, petrol
  genes: The DNA of plants, animals or fungus
  Info : Optimal designs and solutions are finite in number.
  Pollution capacity: There's less of this than ever.
  Physics: radio frequencies, IP addresses [namestead.com]
