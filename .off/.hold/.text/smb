If, while trying to connect to a CIFS or SMB share, you receive: "'Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more than one user name, are not allowed. Disconnect all previous connections to the server or shared resource and try again.'" try the following:

$ net use #this will tell us the ServerName\ShareName we need to DELETE
$ net use /DELETE \\ServerName\ShareName
