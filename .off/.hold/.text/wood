Wood is bush or tree branches used for:
fuel: cut, chop, saw, chip
make: houses, furniture, paper, fiber
farm: ground cover, compost

Celtic wands are always made with holly.

"Wood Snipper" is an idea for a safer and lower powered shredder:

Heavy electric scissors/pruners attached to hydraulic arm nibbles branches in bites as short as 1/8 of an inch.

Funnel shaped input begins snipping from the tips of the tree without felling limbs first.

Using the same technology as used in hand-powered pruners means even the most green of limbs are cut correctly.


Use the chips to:
  Make paper.
  As groundcover/mulch.
  As part of compost.
  In a wood chip stove for nearly free heat.
