"'
/p - Plugs in the specified VHD as a virtual disk device without mounting the volume.

/m - Plugs in the specified VHD as a virtual disk device and mounts the volume.

/f - Performs the specified operation without creating an Undo Disk. This parameter is applicable for /p and /m. All changes to the mounted disk are directly written to the specified VHD.

/u - Unplugs the virtual disk device for the specified VHDFileName.

/c - Updates the original VHD with all changes that were stored in the Undo Disk anddeletes the Undo Disk after unplugging the disk. This parameter is only applicable if the VHD was mounted without using /f.

/d - Discards all changes to the mounted disk and deletes the Undo Disk after unplugging the disk. This parameter is only applicable if the VHD was mounted without using /f.

/q - Displays the disk name of the mounted virtual disk device for the specified VHDFileName.

VHDFileName - VHD name including full path.

DriveLetter - Optional parameter for /m option. If drive letter is specified the volumes are mounted starting at the specified drive letter. If drive letter is not specifiedit is automatically assigned.

All - Applies the operation on all mounted virtual disk devices. This parameter is applicable for /u and /q.

By default, VHDMount creates an Undo Disk in current user's temporary folder. All changes to the mounted disk are written to this Undo Disk. Use /c to commit or /d to discard these changes at the time of unplugging the disk device. Use /f option to mount a VHD without an Undo Disk.

Examples:
VHDMOUNT /p [/f] VHDFileName
VHDMOUNT /m [/f] VHDFileName [DriveLetter]
VHDMOUNT /u [/c | /d] VHDFileName | All
VHDMOUNT /q VHDFileName | All

==Convert
TechNet.Microsoft.com/en-nz/sysinternals/ee656415%28en-us%29.aspx !NON-FREE!>>Disk2vhd is a utility that creates VHD (Virtual Hard Disk - Microsoft's Virtual Machine disk format) versions of physical disks for use in Microsoft Virtual PC or Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs). The difference between Disk2vhd and other physical-to-virtual tools is that you can run Disk2vhd on a system that's online. Disk2vhd uses Windows' Volume Snapshot capability, introduced in Windows XP, to create consistent point-in-time snapshots of the volumes you want to include in a conversion. You can even have Disk2vhd create the VHDs on local volumes, even ones being converted (though performance is better when the VHD is on a disk different than ones being converted).

Code.MSDN.Microsoft.com/wim2vhd >>The Windows(R) Image to Virtual Hard Disk (WIM2VHD) command-line tool allows you to create sysprepped VHD images from any Windows 7 installation source. VHDs created by WIM2VHD will boot directly to the Out Of Box Experience, ready for your first-use customizations. You can also automate the OOBE by supplying your own unattend.xml file, making the possibilities limitless.

NTPro.nl/blog/archives/194-Convert-Virtual-Disks-from-VHD-to-VMDK.html >>Everyone can make a mistake and build a virtual machine on a Windows Virtual Server 2005 R2. Soon you will discover that you made the wrong choice ;-) and want to convert this virtual machine to the VMware VMDK virtual disk format. Arne Fokkema the Dutch ICT-Freak created a little how to and I translated his document. With the latest version of Winimage (8.10) you can convert the VDH virtual disk format to a VMDK virtual disk file. In this case we are going to convert a Longhorn Beta 3 (Windows Virtual Server 2005 R2) virtual machine to a VMware virtual machine.

"'
This does not end here however, because mass storage drivers installed by Windows at install time for VMWare VMs are not compatible with the one Hyper-V is using. This leads to a nice BSOD saying INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE, described here and by the KB314082.

There's two ways to fix this : Create the reg file from the KB article and merge it when the VM is running under VMWare, or mount the VHD disk into an other Hyper-V VM and merge the reg file in the SYSTEM hive of the target OS.

In my case the first possibility was out of the question; Moving the disk again to another machine would have been a waste of time.

That left me with the registry hive mounting solution. Here's how to integrate the registry file :

    * Use another VM to mount the target VHD, to be able to see the SYSTEM hive file.
    * Using the regedit, load the system hive from System32\config\system into HKLM\temp.
    * Modify the KB reg file replace every reference to "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet" by "temp\ControlSet001", and import it to update the default boot configuration
    * Modify again the KB reg file to replace every reference to "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet" by "temp\ControlSet002", to modify the "Last Known Good Configuration", and import it , just in case.
    * Unload the hive.
    * stop the current VM.
    * Boot the new VM using the converted VHD disk, and voilÃ  !

This is time consuming, but worth the trouble, the VM is now working properly under Hyper-V.
