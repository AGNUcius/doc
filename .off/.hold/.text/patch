TIBED.net/vpatch >>VPatch is a free patch generator which can generate small patch files which can update old versions to new versions. This means that if the old version is installed on the user system, you can patch it to the new version, and you don't have to distribute the full new version, only the much smaller patch.

You can find the creation dll in the Platform SDK and the apply dll comes with MSIE 5.01 (maybe with other MS products, I looked on MSDN and found only IE carrying this).
