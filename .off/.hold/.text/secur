This Mode of Production can be brought into the physical world by creating an analogous contract which could be applied to the Means of Production for material objects, so that (for example) the tools used to construct an automobile would be available to any qualified worker to bid upon, with the floor of that auction held to the true costs {invest, insure, maintain, etc.} of those machines, and with any improvements made (that must be approved by voting stakeholders) would also be "locked open" to future users of those machines.  Any amount bid past the floor could be used to purchase more Means of that variety, since high bids indicate high demand.
