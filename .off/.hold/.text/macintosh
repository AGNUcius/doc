MacPorts.org >>The MacPorts Project is an open-source community initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the Mac OS X operating system.  To that end we provide the command-line driven MacPorts software package under a BSD License, and through it easy access to thousands of ports that  greatly simplify the task of compiling and installing open-source software on your Mac.

FinkProject.org >>The Fink project wants to bring the full world of Unix Open Source software to Darwin and Mac OS X.  We modify Unix software so that it compiles and runs on Mac OS X ("port" it) and make it available for download as a coherent distribution.  Fink uses Debian tools like dpkg and apt-get to provide powerful binary package management.  You can choose whether you want to download precompiled binary packages or build everything from source.
