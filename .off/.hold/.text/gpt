In computer hardware, GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a standard for the layout of the partition table on a physical hard disk.  It is a part of the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) standard proposed by Intel as a replacement for the PC BIOS, one of the few remaining parts of the original IBM PC.  EFI uses GPT whereas BIOS uses a Master Boot Record (MBR).
