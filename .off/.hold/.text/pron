Apron:

    1461, faulty separation of a napron (1307), from O.Fr. naperon, dim. of nappe "cloth," from L. mappa "napkin" (cf. adder, umpire). Napron was still found as late as late 16c. Symbolic of "wife's business" from 1611. Apron-string tenure was in ref. to property held in virtue of one's wife, or during her lifetime only.

    c.1505, slang, "beggar's child," originally northern, midlands and western England dialect "makeshift or ragged garment," probably the same word as O.E. bratt "cloak," from a Celtic source (cf. O.Ir. bratt "cloak, cloth"). The modern meaning is perhaps from notion of "child's apron." Bratty is first recorded 1961.

    in nickname, newt, and Brit. dial. naunt, the -n- belongs to a preceding indefinite article an or possessive pronoun mine. Other examples of this from M.E. manuscripts include a neilond ("an island," c.1220), a narawe ("an arrow," c.1400), a noke ("an oak," c.1420), a nappyle ("an apple," c.1420). The process also worked in surnames, from oblique cases of O.E. at "by, near," e.g. Nock/Nokes/Noaks from atten Oke "by the oak;" Nye from atten ye "near the lowland." The loss of it to a preceding a is more common: apron, auger, adder, umpire, humble pie, etc. The mathematical use of n for "an indefinite number" is first recorded 1852, in to the nth power.

adder
    O.E. næddre "a snake," from W.Gmc. *nædro "a snake" (cf. O.N. naðra, M.Du. nadre, Ger. Natter, Goth. nadrs), from PIE base *netr- (cf. L. natrix "water snake," probably by folk-association with nare "to swim;" O.Ir. nathir, Welsh neidr "adder"). The modern form represents a faulty separation 14c.-16c. into an adder, for which see also apron, auger, nickname, humble pie, umpire. Nedder is still a northern Eng. dialect form. Folklore connection with deafness is via Psalm lviii.1-5. The adder is said to stop up its ears to avoid hearing the snaker charmer called in to drive it away, though whether this tradition can account for the O.T. reference I cannot say. Adder-bolt (1483) was a former name for "dragonfly."
