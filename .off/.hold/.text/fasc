A fasces - the root of the word fascism - is a symbol of unity depicted as sticks bound together, usually as an axe handle.

It looks a bit like an '$' with a lightning bolt or upturned 'S' in the middle and a 'Z' at the top and bottom.

"E Pluribus Unum" == "From Many One" and also about unification.

Uniting individuals can create a force larger than themselves.  Humans enjoy collaboration and need cooperation.

"'Fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism, since it is the merger of state and corporate power.'" -- Benito Mussolini

Hypnofascism is unity through religious, party or team spirit.
