Forums.VirtualBox.org/viewtopic.php?t=8046 >>This tutorial is an experiment to see if forum users find it useful to have a single collected reference for some common questions that visitors ask about VDIs, their internals and their use. The tutorial is currently in DRAFT, so don't take the content as full gospel until it has had some level of review from the other VBox "power users" who visit the forum.
