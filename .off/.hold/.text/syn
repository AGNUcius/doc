Wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism >>Syncretism is the attempt to reconcile disparate, even opposing, beliefs and to meld practices of various schools of thought. It is especially associated with the attempt to merge and analogize several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, and thus assert an underlying unity.

Syndicalism \Syn"dic*al*ism\, n. [F. syndicalisme.]
   The theory, plan, or practice of trade-union action
   (originally as advocated and practiced by the French
   Conf['e]d['e]ration G['e]n['e]rale du Travail) which aims to
   abolish the present political and social system by means of
   the general strike (as distinguished from the local or
   sectional strike) and direct action of whatever kind (as
   distinguished from action which takes effect only through the
   medium of political action) -- direct action including any
   kind of action that is directly effective, whether it be a
   simple strike, a peaceful public demonstration, sabotage, or
   revolutionary violence. By the general strike and direct
   action syndicalism aims to establish a social system in which
   the means and processes of production are in the control of
   local organizations of workers, who are manage them for the
   common good.
