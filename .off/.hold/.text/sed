sed.sf.net >>Sed is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it is sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

sedsed.sf.net >>Sedsed is a Python script that masters SED scripts. It generates SED debug files in SED, which lets you debug scripts with your own version of SED (Linux, DOS, etc.). It's also a script beautifier, doing indentation and spaces/comments formatting. It can also convert SED scripts to colorful HTML files. It's GPL.
