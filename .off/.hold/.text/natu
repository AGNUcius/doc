God was nature, especially the Sun until hoarders began cloaking truth for usury.

Nature is the physics and ecology of reality: humans, organisms, soil, sun, water, cycles, genetics, interdependence.

God is the word (DNA) made flesh (organisms).
The bright and morning star (sun).
Saviour and redeemer (permaculture).
The beginning and the end (time).
Spirit of god, like a fire is burning (sun, pyramid)
"Love one another" = Cooperate with all organisms and humans.
"Follow me" = Understand our interdependence and how others will use it against us.
"And have eternal life" = Your genetics will continue.


Psalms 104:14 "'He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth.'"

John 3:16 "'God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.'"  Eternal genetic life through physical salvation copying.


Who turns the water into the wine?
Is it not the sun and creeping grapevine?

From where comes our milk, our honey our bread?
What about boots, shoes, dresses and beds?

They are all made with labor, creatures and land.
But also tools from metal, petrol and sand.

All mass from nature.
No other source be.

The beginning, The end.
Absolute supremacy.
