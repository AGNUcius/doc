The word 'Lord' was written in Old English as "Hlaf Weard" which is literally "Loaf Warden" or "Bread Guard".  This is yet another example of how some of the psychological power of religion stems from the message of physical salvation and genetic perpetuation that is carried in the literal wording of works such as the Holy Bible.


The Holy Bible speaks of the Lord driving Adam and Eve from the garden to weeds work for bread by the sweat of their brow until the hour of the usury beast described in Revelations.
