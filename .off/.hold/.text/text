Docwit.sf.net >>Docwit solves the problem where you want to use a collaborative web-based document system, but you don't want an external company (like Google or Adobe) to host your data.    We've used one of the most popular open source HTML wysiwyg editor components (TinyMCE), an open-source diff/patch library that Google happen to use (google-diff-match-patch), and some custom code to produce a light, cheap (effort-wise, free cost-wise) kind of collaborative editor. It's intended to be something simple that can be combined into your existing systems. For example, an early intended use is with the Sakai 3 courseware management system. However, the webapp package can just be run as a server itself so you can see it in action.
