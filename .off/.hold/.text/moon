The Reverend Father Sun Myung Moon claims to be our spiritual Father and the successor of Jesus.  He and his wife claim to be our TrueParents.org

He marries thousands of humans at once.  He says the cross should be buried in the name of unity.  He owns the Washington Times newspaper.

Myung literally translates Sun-Moon, so his full name is:
    Sun Sun Moon Moon

 moon far gone, lightning splits night
 ticking and clicking, mixing with dust
 cleaning leaves, splattering soil
 pounding, driving, exposing rock
 rivlets cut clay, puddle and pool
 clouds roll off, shelter drips
 a fragile mist rises as dawn warms land
 the germ hears the call to life
 swelling and heaving, it climbs from it's (s)hell
 sprouting to break free, rooting to stand
 this bread source faces the first day for man
 but the sower does not own, neither the reaper nor eater
 it is the investor and shareholder that own this people
