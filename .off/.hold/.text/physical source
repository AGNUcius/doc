Our universe is dualistic
physical/virtual
temporal/spiritual
instantiate/design
instance/type
host/code
dust/DNA


Physical sources are the rivalrous, material aspects of reality such as space, time, mass and energy required to host (store and express) all virtual things.

* The design of a table may be held in a brain, then probably written on paper or with CAD software, and eventually constructed with tools, wood, and skilled labor.
* A play writer expresses ideas onto paper with ink and skilled labor.
** Paper, ink, light and reading express a play to an actor.
** An actor, his skill and labor and the food he ate express a play to an audience.

Changing a virtual resource usually implies you are changing a *copy* of it.  Copying virtual resources is never zero cost.

Changing a physical resource usually implies you are changing this specific instance, so must be more carefully considered.

Material and Virtual objects differ across the actions of Consuming, Changing and Copying:

Rivalrous: Does this action diminish the freedom of others? (theatre seating)
Exclusive: Does this action eliminate this freedom for others? (eating a sandwich)
Infinitely repeatable? (copying organisms or software)
