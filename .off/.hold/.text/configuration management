Paella.berliOS.de >>Paella is a installation/configuration management system centered on being able to easily define, configure, maintain and update systems and networks.  The define, configure and install parts are working well.  The update and maintain portions still have yet to be realized.    Paella is not a fully extensible installer that can work in a variety of environments.  The debian-installer works much better for a generic installer.  The paella installer is designed to be run from a live system (preferably built with DebianLive) with access to a postgresql database, and a debian mirror.  It's mainly tested and used with a "net" live image, but it can be used from cdrom, or external USB.  It can also install a system in a chroot environment, although not all the features are supported in this case.
