Bringing Free as in Freedom to all physical kind
By renting sources "at cost" we all make or buy.

By GPLing most of our productive means,
Workers rent "at cost" - without usury.

Property left then gives consumers the keys,
For social production by hoarding contained.

It is slowly becoming true for some software, even games.
For audio, for video, genetics and drug and beer designs.

SUN GPLed the Sparc, OpenCores.org and FreeIO.org share specs,
But these are all only virtual - we must move into real space.

Corporate shareholders profit by locking nature closed,
General Public Lease gives freedom making hoarding old.
