"'
 free culture is a movement for creative empowerment and artistic freedom
  The free culture movement is based on four core freedoms...

...to use
we shouldn't be told how to listen to music, or be prevented from reading a book in any way we like.

...to create
we should have the right and ability to create new works and to transform existing works into remixes without unnecessary constraint.

...to share
we're always taught to share as children, so why is copying a CD for a friend or sharing your work with millions frowned upon?

...to learn
we can learn more about cultures, and improve our own critical and creative skills when having access to the raw materials and tools.
