"'It's not just that corporations buy media time and drown out other voices.  In some cases corporations buy the media.  Westinghouse and General Electric, major defense contractors and polluters, own CBS and NBC. Can we expect them to report objectively on themselves?  Due to deregulation, fewer and fewer giant corporations control what's in print and on television.  The media make much of their money from ad revenue and hesitate to report, especially critically, on advertisers.'" -- GlobalExchange.org/economy/corporations/nike/20030501_668.html
