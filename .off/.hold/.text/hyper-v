I find it very interesting for IT Pros like us to build scripts to manage and provision virtual machines through WMI. When combining PowerShell with WMI, you really have powerful tools in your hands for managing virtual environments.

It enables one or more guest operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical computer. Key uses for virtual machine technology include the following:    * Server consolidation    * Consolidation of development and testing environments    * Simplified disaster recovery

This type of environment is useful because you can create and manage virtual machines, which allows you to run multiple operating systems on one physical computer and isolate the operating systems from each other. This guide introduces Hyper-V by providing instructions for installing this role and configuring a virtual machine.
