Eckbox.sf.net >>Eckbox is software designed to aid in a specific type of security testing against a spying attack known as van Eck Phreaking or TEMPEST. It involves picking up radiation leaking from an electronic device, such as a monitor, and interpreting the signal to recreate the data contained in the device. This can be thought of as a sort of shoulder-surfing. Eckbox is the first and only open-source software designed that helps to test against this kind of attack. But it's still in early development, so feel free to contribute code, ideas, designs, advice, and nonthreatening e-mails :).

"Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution" -- Steven Levy

* Access to anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-on Imperative!
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust authority—promote decentralizatioin.
* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race or position.
* You can create art and beauty through hacking.
* This true education can change your life for the better.
