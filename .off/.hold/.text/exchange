42tools.com >>Our main product is an Open Source connector for Microsoft Exchange 5.5, 2000, 2003, 2007 and later versions. Our aim is to scratch one of the most annoying itches that the Open Source community have endured. This particular itch has been experienced for almost a decade. The problem that we are addressing is the problem of platform independent access for client applications to Microsoft Exchange from version 5.5 onwards. Our solution to this problem will enable a feature-by-feature compatible Microsoft Outlook replacement for LinuxÂ®, Microsoft WindowsÂ®, the BSDs or almost any other platform.
