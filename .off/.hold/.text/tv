Wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television_in_the_United_States >>Even though the ATSC channel uses the same 6 MHz bandwidth as the NTSC channel it replaces, the ATSC channels can be packed in adjacent channel slots, whereas with NTSC transmission technology it is not possible to transmit on adjacent channels in the same geographic area. This allows the U.S. government to implement its plans of removing a portion of the VHF and UHF spectra from television uses and auctioning (resulting in a revenue stream of perhaps billions of dollars) some frequencies off to make them available for commercial voice and data services. Other frequencies will be reserved for government and public service.

Analog TV broadcast switch-off: In December 2005, the Senate passed a budget bill that calls for over-the-air television stations to cease their analog broadcasts by February 17, 2009. After that date, TVs and other gear with old-style NTSC tuners would be unable to receive over-the-air broadcasts. Part of the government's quandary is that the switch-off would cause thousands of TVs to go dark and would deprive many lower-income viewers of their only source of television. To address this issue, lawmakers propose to subsidize converter boxes that would allow people to watch the new digital broadcasts on their old analog TVs. Further details on the transition to digital and the converter box subsidy are still being worked out, and given the slow progress over the last 9 years since the introduction of digital and HDTV, we wouldn't be surprised to hear of more changes before 2009.
