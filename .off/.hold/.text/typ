==Type vs. Instance
RMS claims at GNU.org/philosophy/why-free.html that comparing software and spaghetti is an overstretched analogy.

But this conclusion may be invalid because the comparison he makes is between the Type of one Object (all possible copies of a computer program) and a single Instance of another Object (one particular copy of spaghetti).

Discussion of Free Software licenses has limited our investigation to the virtual realm of information because that happens to be the domain of Copyright.  But all information requires a physical host, so the real differences between Software and Spaghetti are much smaller than they appear.

: Software can NOT be copied without access to physical Sources of Production.  It requires land, a computer, at least one instance of the software, magnetic or optical media, tools, energy and time.

: Spaghetti CAN be copied with access to physical Sources of Production.  It requires land, soil, at least one wheat seed, water, tools, energy and time.


===A revised analogy
+ Comparing Type (infinite info):
> All POSSIBLE COPIES of this software type; limited by physical Sources.
: If you run or change your OWN INSTANCE of a program I wrote affects you directly and me only indirectly.  Whether you give a copy to your friend affects you and your friend much more than it affects me.  I shouldn't have the power to tell you not to do these things.  No one should.  Not even Microsoft.

> All POSSIBLE COPIES of this spaghetti type; limited by physical Sources.
: If you eat your OWN INSTANCE of that type of spaghetti affects you directly and me only indirectly.  Whether you give a copy to your friend affects you and your friend much more than it affects me.  I shouldn't have the power to tell you not to do these things.  No one should.  Not even Monsanto.


+ Comparing Instance (rivalrous mass):
> The CD/DVD, Hard Drive or RAM that host THIS COPY of the software.
: When I write software, I do object if someone else takes THAT INSTANCE, because then I cannot also use it.  His action hurts me exactly as much as it benefits him; only one of us can use THAT PARTICULAR COPY, so the question is, which?

> The mashed and pressed wheat seeds (noodles) that host THIS COPY of spaghetti.
: When I cook spaghetti, I do object if someone else eats THAT INSTANCE, because then I cannot eat it.  His action hurts me exactly as much as it benefits him; only one of us can eat the spaghetti, so the question is, which?

==Physical hosts Virtual
All physical things are hosts for the storage and expression of virtual things.

Information (any virtual thing) must be hosted by material goods that have the physical properties of "mass" or "energy".

===Examples
* Audio and Video is hosted on a wide variety of physical things including a metal cylinder, grooved plastic discs, photoreactive film, etc.
* Software is usually stored on optical or magnetic media and is expressed with a computer and electricity.
* Mechanical design is stored on paper (blueprints) or on a computer (CAD) and is expressed with machines that copy (manufacture) that design.
* Genetics (DNA) is stored in seeds, spores, eggs or living organisms and expressed through water, soil, air, and sun.
