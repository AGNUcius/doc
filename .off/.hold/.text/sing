sing: song, music

NetFuture.org/2007/May1007_169.html >>Just as speech is light-like, so, too, the raying light has from ancient times been understood as speech-like. In the Upanishads it is recorded that "the Sun is sound; therefore they say of the Sun, ’He proceeds resounding’". Coomaraswamy, drawing on the ancient texts of the east, summarizes the matter this way: "The shining of the Supernal Sun is then as much an ’utterance’ as a ’raying’; he, indeed ’speaks’", and "the Sun himself ’sings’ as much as he ’shines’" (1977, pp. 153n, 193).
