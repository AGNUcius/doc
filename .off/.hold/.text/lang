ZWDisplay.sf.net >>ZWDisplay is a desktop program to assist learners of Mandarin to understand and learn to read Chinese text.  When the user enters Chinese-language text, ZWDisplay will display the text with the pronunciation of each word (in Pinyin) and an English translation.  If the user clicks on any Chinese language text, ZWDisplay will hide the Pinyin and translation ('known words'). Clicking it again will restore them.  ZWDisplay will store the known words in a file. This file can be imported into PlecoDict (in text format) to create flashcards. This enables one to choose vocabulary to learn based on one's reading.  The name ZWDisplay is short for zhongwen [Chinese writing] display.
