Efficient design minimizes code by maximizing "pass through" of data or material.

Grace.OpenPanel.com >>This project is not for C++ purists.  Code written for Grace will look more like python or php than your run-of-the-mill C++ program.  Much of this purity has been sacrificed to the gods of legibility, and that is what you will gain: Code that you can read back the next morning that will still make sense, even if it touches nasty subjects like threading and text munging.

QuickFunctor.sf.net >>The QuickFunctor library consists of a collection of template classes and global functions to facilitate creation of and working with "functors", or "function objects", i.e. classes implementing an operator(). The functors in QuickFunctor are a substantial improvement (IMHO) over what the standard provides, with things like composition, expressions, "transform" operations, and even the naming convention.
