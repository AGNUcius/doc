Pleyades.net/david/sakura.php >>sakura is a terminal emulator based on GTK and VTE. It's a terminal emulator with few dependencies, so you don't need a full GNOME desktop installed to have a decent terminal emulator. Current terminal emulators based on VTE are  gnome-terminal, XFCE Terminal, TermIt and a small sample program included in the vte sources. The differences between sakura and the last one are that it uses a notebook to provide several terminals in one window and adds a contextual menu with some basic options. No more no less.

VicerVeza.HomeUnix.net/~viric/soft/tm >>This program can start processes inside a pseudo-terminal, which can be accessed through a Unix socket, TCP or even raw ethernet (using the ethernet protocol 0xCACA). The programs can be linked to the current terminal, or they can be unlinked like in nohup. But even in this latter case you can connect to them using the mentioned protocols.
