http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CDM >>CDM is a minimalistic, yet full-featured replacement for login-managers like slim, kdm, gdm and qingy  that provides a fast, dialog-based login system without the overhead of the X Window System or the instability of qingy. Written in pure bash, CDM has no other dependencies, yet supports multiple users/sessions and can start virtually any DE/WM.
