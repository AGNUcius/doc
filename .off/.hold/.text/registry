www.CodeProject.com/KB/applications/NtRegEdit.aspx >>I wanted to create a registry editor that used the "Native Registry APIs" instead of using the Microsoft Registry APIs in AdvApi32.dll (which is just a wrapper to the Native Registry APIs). There is still dependency to the AdvApi32.dll because of the all the other APIs in it. I basically wrote a class that does this (I guess it is also a wrapper - see picture below). I wanted to create something that would have the same functionality as Microsoft's Registry Editor but with the ability to do a lot more. I liked working with the SDI Framework, and decided to start with that. I also wanted to make it a bit easier to read the registry data, so I decided on color coding. This would make it easier for a user to color the information to their liking, making it easier to read and more user-friendly.

Self-contained registry scripts

In .REG files, every line after the first one that starts with a semicolon (;) is treated as comment.
Batch files completely ignore the semicolons before commands.
So the following batch file will use itself as a .REG file:

REGEDIT4

; @ECHO OFF
; CLS
; REGEDIT.EXE /S "%~f0"
; EXIT

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Test]
"TestVal"="Succeeded"

The REGEDIT4 line is required, and must be the first line, otherwise REGEDIT.EXE won't accept the script as a valid .REG file. However, it will generate an error message when running as a batch file, hence the CLS command to wipe the error message from the screen.
To prevent more error messages, EXIT is used to abort the batch file immediately after the REGEDIT.EXE command.
