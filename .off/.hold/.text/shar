==NFS shares
Following condensed frm http://mybeni.rootzilla.de/mybeNi/2007/how_to_set_up_nfs_and_how_to_share_files_in_a_local_network_with_ubuntu_linux

Share /media/music from 'ERNIE':
$ sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server

Add a line to /etc/exports:
$ ECHO "/media/music BERT(ro,async,all_squash)" >> /etc/exports

Restart the NFS Server
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart


Connect and mount from 'BERT'
$ sudo apt-get install nfs-common
$ mkdir /var/music
$ sudo mount ernie:/media/music /var/music

To automount at start, add a line to /etc/fstab
$ ECHO "ernie:/media/music  /var/music     nfs r,hard   0  0" >> /etc/fstab

. Maybe add line to /etc/hosts.allow
. Maybe open ports 111, 2049, 32771 (from client and server, but not from router).
. Adjust server firewall to allow connections from client IP
. Add client IP to the file /etc/hosts on server

on server:
$ sudo exportfs -ra
$ sudo /etc/init.d/portmap/ restart
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart
