cdstatus.sf.net >>cdstatus is a tool for diagnosing cdrom drive and cd problems, and for performing digital data (music audio) extraction. It will query the drive status, and report what the system thinks the status is. Due to problems, systems have been known to disagree with users as to the status of a drive. (The user says "the cd is in there" the drive says "door open". Time to try another cdrom drive (or close the door).

CafXX.StrayOrange.com/RedDisc >>RedDisc (REDundant DISC) is a system to add parity information to optical medias, to avoid data losses. The system is made up of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The former uses the free space left on the media to add transparent parity data. The latter, in case of unreadable sectors, tries to recover them by using the parity data.

Packet-CD.sf.net "'
There are three methods for writing data (or audio) to a CD using a CD recorder: Track-at-Once (TAO), Disc-at-Once (DAO) and Packet Writing. Track-at-Once is, by far, the most popular method today. Both Track-at-Once and Disc-at-Once use a table of contents mechanism to look up each chunk of data written to the disc. Use of a Table of Contents (TOC) requires that each session (or disc) must be closed at the end of a write, updating the table of contents which allows that session to be readable. Use of TAO and DAO methods also requires the creation of an ISO image before the disc may be written; converting the data from its form on your filesystem to a form that can be cleanly written to CD.

Packet writing is a method quite different from TAO and DAO; it is designed for writing data to CD in small increments. Packet writing must be supported by hardware (not all CD writers support packet writing). The largest benefit in packet writing comes in its ease of use; packet writing enables the user to copy files to CD without mastering any images previously, allowing someone to copy files to CD without requiring significant technical knowledge. Combined with a CD-RW drive and CD-RW media, packet writing provides an extremely simple, versatile, and inexpensive method for performing regular backup of crucial data.

Advantages of Disk-At-Once (DAO) Recording
    Recording in disk-at-once mode writes the complete disc, i.e. lead-in, one or more tracks and lead-out, in a single step. The commonly used track-at-once (TAO) mode writes each track independently which requires link blocks between two tracks. Older CD-recorder models forced a two second pause (pre-gap) between two tracks whereas newer models allow adjusting of the pause length in TAO mode reducing the number of link blocks to a minimal amount. However, with TAO it is generally not possible to define the data that is written in pre-gaps. But exactly this feature makes audio CD recording interesting, e.g. by creating hidden bonus tracks or track intros in pre-gaps like it is common habit on commercial CDs.
    Finally, DAO recording is the only way to write data to the unused R-W sub-channels for e.g.  CD-G or CD-TEXT.

To create a non bootable TAO data iso:
$ mkisofs -v -J -l -L -r -o data.iso /path/to/directory

$ cdrecord -scanbus #find destination device name
If that doesn't work you can specify the device with it's filesystem pathname:

$ cdrecord -dev=/dev/cdrw -scanbus
Should return something like:
> 1,0,0	  0) 'PIONEER ' 'DVD-RW  DVR-106D' '1.05' Removable CD-ROM

If you need to blank first:
$ cdrecord -dev=1,0,0 -blank=fast #to blank a rewritable disk

Now write the ISO to disk:
$ cdrecord -v -dev=1,0,0 -eject data.iso #burn the ISO

To make an iso that boots from a floppy image:
First create a bootable floppy.
Then create a boot image file from that floppy:
$ dd if=\\.\a: of=boot.img bs=10k count=144 #w32
$ dd if=/dev/fd0 of=boot.img bs=10k count=144 #*nix

Now create the bootable ISO with that image: (it seems you must be _in_ the directory you are archiving, so the command will look more like:)
$ mkisofs -v -J -l -L -r -b boot.img -c boot.catalog -o data.iso . #(notice the trailing '.')

Copy directly from one CD drive to another: the destination is specified with the `-dev=' param, and the source is specified as a device name
$ cdrecord -v -dev=1,0,0 -isosize \\.\f: #on w32
$ cdrecord -v -dev=1,0,0 -isosize /dev/cdrom #on nix
