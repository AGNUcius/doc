The keys to the kingdom lead to a land of plenty.

The king of kings is the sun among stars.

Owners are king!

The symbol "The Kingdom of GOD" is both:
    The utopia of (physical) salvation through abundance.
    Represents private ownership, and how only those with keys may enter.
    The evangelists tend to present it as a reason to invade.

Christ is another crucified king.
