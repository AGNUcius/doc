CHI + RHO: first two letters of Greek Khri-stos, Christ.

Adopted by Constantine after his vision of a cross in the heavens just before battle with Maxentius, A.D. 312.

The vision included the revelation of the phrase:
    IN HOC SIGNO VINCES
    IN THIS SIGN CONQUER

Constantine also minted coins with the phrase "Sol Invictus" = "The Invincible Sun" and created the Catholic church at Nicea.  Work on Sunday was outlawed.

MicroSCOft's codename for the XP OS was "cairo".
