In economic terms, a 'good' is an object or output of production.  For example: an apple is a good, while the apple tree is one of the sources of that good.

Goods and services are usually treated differently, but each can be viewed in terms of the other.

For instance, an apple could alternatively be thought of as the ordered list of services applied to the sources of that production (plant, harvest, store, etc.).

From the other side, an example usually considered a service - such as cutting your hair - could be viewed as the final product = "cut hair".

Imagining the work being designed out of existience or automated away by machines (even robots) may help make this more clear.
