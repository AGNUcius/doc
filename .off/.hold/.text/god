God was originally the saving bounty of nature, especially from the Sun, but also the success of the community it supported.

The original intent of religion was the true morality of peace and abundance through organic cooperation as love of human organisms and reverent domination of all others.

Owners are lord through law:
. Gods may create abundance or scarcity.
. Abundance begets peace.
. But scarcity allows usury, which begets domination and finally war.
. Feudalists are gods turned beast.

God holds the keys to access the kingdom:
  Nature is god with permaculture the key.
  Owners are god with literal keys.

God is lord = "hlaf weard" = "loaf guard" = "bread guard" = owner.

Cooperatism creates landless gods by renting keys to washed (qualified) artisans at cost.

Reality can be explained without divinity or devils.

If you participate in any of the divisive monothestic religions you may be unknowingly worshipping the most visible of all = the Sun.

Our reptilian based brains tend to worship the SUN directly because it creates such a difference in reality each day and year (light, heat, agriculture, etc.).

Constantine used this knowledge in Nicea to form the kernel of modern christianity, which is a cloaked sun worship.

Moses said the land would flow with milk and honey.  Where do milk and honey come from?

Thoth teaches life is based on the eternals truths of nature.

The eternals truths of nature include the human needs of air, water, food/drugs, cloth, soap -- all of which be solved with access to land and promotion of permaculture, just as they were in The Garden of Eden before the owner kicked them out for learning too much.



"'    To the King my lord, my sun, my god, the breath of my life... your slave and dust under your feet. At the feet of the King my lord, my sun, my god, the breath of my life, I bowed down seven times seven times. I heard the words of the tablets of the King my lord, my sun, my god, the breath of my life, and the heat of your slave and the dust under the feet of the King, my lord, my sun, my god, the breath of my life, is exceeding glad that the breath of the King my lord, my sun, my god has gone out to his slave and to the dust under his feet.
     
    Who is your servant but a dog? and they prostrate themselves before the Pharaoh Seven times and seven times on both back and belly.'" -- The Amarna Letters (Late Bronze Age, 14th century BCE)


"'BIGOT, meaning an obstinate and intolerant holder of particular religious opinions, arrived in English via French. It originated centuries before among Germanic/Frankish tribes of Gaul. 'Bei Gott' ('By God') mocked the exclamation frequently used by the crusading Christian missionaries who were bludgeoning the tribes into conversion.'" -- jesusneverexisted.com
