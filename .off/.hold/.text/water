Citizen.org/cmep/water >>As the world's water becomes scarce and corporations seek to exploit this scarcity for profit, people around the world are losing ownership and control of water resources on which they depend. Water is a human right; to the extent one has the right to live, one has the right to water. Public Citizen's Water for All Campaign is dedicated to protecting water as a common resource, stopping water privatization and bulk water sales, and defending access to clean and affordable water around the world.

"'In the late 1990s, the World Bank conditioned debt relief and other development assistance to Bolivia on the country's agreement to privatize the public water system of its third-largest city, Cochabamba. In 1999, in a process with just one bidder, the California-based engineering giant Bechtel was granted a 40-year lease to take over Cochabamba's water through a subsidiary, Aguas del Tunari (AdT), formed for that purpose.'" -- http://EarthJustice.org/urgent/display.html?ID=107

Water is a basic human need.  Water rights are being sold by corporatism infested governments to large corporations who proceed to lock it up.  The water privatization is being used to create an artificial scarcity to concentrate wealth.  When a human can't pay, they die for lack.

"'Today, companies like France's Suez are rushing to privatise water, already a $400 billion global business. They are betting that water will be to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th" (Fortune Magazine, May 15, 2000 p 55).'" -- aftinet.org.au/papers/ranald2.html


"'In the last five years, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been insisting on privatizing DAWASA, as a condition to include Tanzania in the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. HIPC inclusion provides Tanzania with a significant debt service relief, theoretically worth billions of dollars. Unfortunately, conditional structural reforms, including water supply privatization, however often are a high price to pay.

This is not an IMF demand that is unique to its Tanzania policy. The fund is promoting water supply privatization all over the African continent, often causing protests from civil society and international anti-globalization groups. Although African state-owned water suppliers mostly are ineffective and run-down, they at least have provided many urban poor people with cheap or free water. Protesters claim these international takeovers are excluding the poor from an affordable clean water supply.

In all fairness, the water supply and sanitation of Dar es Salaam indeed doesn't have the best of reputations. According to the DAWASA's "owner" Festus Libu, Tanzanian Minister of Water, "infrastructure built in the 1970s is deteriorating rapidly." It is estimated that 50 percent of the water is lost through leakage and illegal links to the system. Minister Libu insists DAWASA is suffering "from poor billing and revenue collection and inadequate water sources both in terms of quality and quantity." Naturally after privatizing over 300 state-owned enterprises, the Tanzanian government agrees to the IMF cure of privatizing DAWASA.

Every day 30,000 children in the Third World die of preventable causes. Many of them could be saved if they had access to safe water. The World Bank argues that governments in impoverished countries have to privatize their water supply and distribution systems if they are to get the efficient delivery of water that is needed.'" -- http://YellowTimes.org/article.php?sid=369
