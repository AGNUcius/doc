GliBench.sf.net >>GliBench is a Gui based benchmarking tool to check your computer's CPU and hard disk performance. It is based on the benchmarks I developed for  CliBench Mk III SMP a SMP enabled benchmark program for Win32. There were several tries to port it to other architectures than Win32, but this was not that easy. So I decided to to a Linux port, based on the GTK toolkit with Gnome support, as Linux runs on almost every hardware around and GTK is quite easy to port to other OSs.

Coker.com.au/bonnie++ >>Bonnie++ is a benchmark suite that is aimed at performing a number of simple tests of hard drive and file system performance. Then you can decide which test is important and decide how to compare different systems after running it. I have no plans to ever have it produce a single number, because I don't think that a single number can be useful when comparing such things.
