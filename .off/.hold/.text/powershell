ComputerPerformance.co.uk/ezine >>What to expect from Guy's Scripting Ezine? My speciality is getting people started.  Once people are up and running I like to support them with simple scripts, which are annotated with learning points and notes. Each article has at least one script which you can copy and paste, moreover, I hope that you will be able to use the notes and examples to modify the code to suit your environment. For the last year I have switched from VBScript to PowerShell, consequently the ezine now features PowerShell cmdlets rather than VB scripts.

Microsoft.com/powershell >>Microsoft Windows PowerShell command line shell and scripting language helps IT professionals achieve greater control and productivity. Using a new admin-focused scripting language, more than 130 standard command line tools, and consistent syntax and utilities, Windows PowerShell allows IT professionals to more easily control system administration and accelerate automation. Windows PowerShell is easy to adopt, learn, and use, because it works with your existing IT infrastructure and existing script investments, and because it runs on Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2003. Windows PowerShell is now included as part of Windows Server 2008 and can be evaluated in Windows Server 2008 Beta 3. Exchange Server 2007, System Center Operations Manager 2007, System Center Data Protection Manager V2, and System Center Virtual Machine Manager also leverage Windows PowerShell to improve administrator control, efficiency, and productivity.
