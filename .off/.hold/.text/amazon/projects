Launchpad.net/s3daemon (c/c++) >>The Amazon S3 file transfer daemon is a daemon process that runs in the background and monitors folders. When it finds a file in one of the folders that matches a specific pattern it transfers that file to S3 storage and then removes the local copy. The folders monitored and the patterns searched for are controlled by a configuration file.

QUILLEN.GoogleCode.com >>When you backup a file or directory, Quillen places those files into a conceptual "snapshot". It is a full snapshot of those files at that point in time. A snapshot can later be restored to your local disk.  Quillen splits files into chunks of data of variable size. The chunks are determined by their contents, rather than fixed offsets into a file. This enables Quillen to keep data transfer and storage to a minimum since only chunks that have not been seen before will be uploaded. Chunks have an average size of 128K, although they can range from 2K - 5MB. This method of chunking also means that a full backup of a set of files that have already been placed in a snapshot does not result in re-uploading those files. And if the files have changed since they were last backed up, only those chunks that have changed need to be uploaded. The result is a new full snapshot. The full set of files can be restored from that snapshot. This is de-duplication between snapshots.  This method of chunking also enables de-duplication within snapshots. If two files are both backed up at the same time, and the two files share chunks of data, each of those chunks is only uploaded and stored once. Quillen keeps track of the fact that a chunk is referenced by multiple files.

Resourceful.CodePlex.com >>Resourceful is a lightweight .net library for creating RESTful (or resource-oriented) web service clients and servers. Intended to be as cross-platform as possible, currently tested against mono on mac/linux (1.2.5+) and silverlight (beta 2).

AWSEC2SOAP.CodePlex.com >>This sample library (along with a test program) shows simply how to access EC2 services via Microsoft's C# and Visual Studio and the SOAP interface (not REST).  If you want REST, you can download a REST C# library from Amazon's website. The advantage to this method (SOAP) is that when Amazon updates the API, all you have to do (in Visual Studio) is to refresh a query to the WSDL site and viola! - API will have been updated. This is handy as Amazon continues to add features to this cool service.

Currently, it exports a user-facing interface that is compatible with the Amazon EC2 and S3 services but the platform is modularized so that it can support a set of different interfaces simultaneously. The development of Eucalyptus software is sponsored by Eucalyptus Systems, a venture-backed start-up.[2] Eucalyptus works with most currently available Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), OpenSUSE, Debian and Fedora. Similarly Eucalyptus can use a variety of virtualization technologies including VMware, Xen and KVM hypervisors to implement the cloud abstractions it supports. Eucalyptus is an acronym for "Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs To Useful Systems".
