gsutil allows you to store, share and manage data hosted at cloud-based storage providers. It supports a URI syntax for naming data, as well as URI wildcards. For example, the following command will retrieve all of the objects in the bucket "gs://mybucket", and store them in a local directory:

gsutil cp gs://mybucket/* local_directory

At present gsutil works with Google Storage for Developers and Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3).

gsutil is implemented in Python, atop the popular boto open source library. That library is included automatically when you download or check out gsutil from this site.

Google implemented gsutil in part to demonstrate how to get the most out of Google Storage, and also to make it easier for developers to build their apps or tools.
