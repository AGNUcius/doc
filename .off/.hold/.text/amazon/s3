Simple Storage Service

http://Cloudiquity.com/2009/03/differences-between-s3-and-ebs

Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web

So if I am not wrong: Both actually are designed to allow the storage and both provide the Web Services on top of that. Both are capable of configuring the machine instances.

While S3 is easily scalable, we have to manually take care of the scalability of EBS instance. Would that be a correct conclusion?

Yes both EBS and S3 are designed to allow the storage.
EBS allows to create volumes and format them where as S3 provides web services interface which can be used to sore/retreive data.

Some main differences are:
1. EBS can only be accessed by one machine at a time whereas snapshots on S3 can be shared
2. performance of S3 is higher
3. S3 has  maximum  throughput
4. For file listing S3 is slow and search is by prefix only  whereas EBS has fast directory listing and searching.

Yes S3 is scalable, we have to manually take care of the scalability of EBS instance.

EBS is actually a SAN storage, with all SAN benefits.
You can do a snapshot, unmount and remount the volume to different instances, and connect an AMI for persistent offline storage.

S3 is sort of a NAS, with a proprietary access protocol, but with data replication and uber high availability.

Which one to chose? depends on the use case, on the budget, on the skills and the tools you have.
