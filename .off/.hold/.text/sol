"'Mithra or Mitra is even worshipped as Itu (Mitra-Mitu-Itu) in every house of the Hindus in India.  Itu (derivative of Mitu or Mitra) is considered as the Vegetation-deity.  This Mithra or Mitra (Sun-God) is believed to be a Mediator between God and man, between the Sky and the Earth.  It is said that Mithra or Sun took birth in the Cave on December 25th.  It is also the belief of the Christian world that Mithra or the Sun-God was born of Virgin.  He travelled far and wide.  He has twelve satellites, which are taken as the Sun's disciples....  [The Sun's] great festivals are observed in the Winter Solstice and the Vernal Equinox--Christmas and Easter.  His symbol is the Lamb....'" -- Swami Prajnanananda, "Christ the Saviour and Christ Myth", 1961 -- www.truthbeknown.com/mithra.htm
