http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/archive/2008/01/02/the-basics-of-single-instance-storage-sis-in-wss-2003-r2-and-wudss-2003.aspx "'SIS was originally introduced as part of the RIS (Remote Installation Services) in Windows Server 2000, but at that time it was restricted to volumes used by RIS to hold multiple installations of Windows.

RIS has since been replaced by Windows Deployment Services (WDS), which leverages the WIM file format for the de-duplication of Windows installation files.

Today, SIS is only included as part of WSS 2003 R2 and WUDSS 2003.'"
