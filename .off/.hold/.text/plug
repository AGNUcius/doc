C-Pluff.org >>C-Pluff is a plug-in framework for C programs. It has been strongly inspired by the Java plug-in framework in Eclipse. C-Pluff focuses on providing core services for plug-in interaction and plug-in management. It aims to be platform neutral and supports dynamic changes to plug-in configuration without stopping the whole application or framework. It does not yet provide special facilities for distribution such as signed plug-in packages or remote plug-in repositories but it is possible to build such features on top of the current framework.
