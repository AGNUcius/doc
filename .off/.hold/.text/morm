Mormo \Mor"mo\, n. [Gr. mormw` a hideous she-monster, a
   bugbear.]
   A bugbear; false terror. [Obs.] --Jonhson.

The Mormons are a Masonic experiment.

Old Joe and his pop had been using dowsing and seer stones to look for gold for years.  They never found any so concocted another religion around the lie that an angel handed him some golden plates.  It's so unoriginal as to be disinteresting if it weren't so successful.

We choose to no longer base our lives, and the lives of our children, on so-called truths dictated by others.

a review of "In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith -- Todd Compton"

Through the biographies he has constructed, Compton exposes each of these myths. Chapter 1 discusses Fanny Alger, who married Joseph when she was only sixteen and he was twenty-seven. Emma didn't know about the marriage, and when she learned of it (by seeing Fanny and Joseph together, by one account, and noticing Fanny's pregnancy by another account - see pages 34-35) drove Fanny from their house. Oliver Cowdery (one of the Book-of-Mormon witnesses) described Joseph's relationship with Fanny as a sexual affair, and accused Joseph of adultery - resulting in Oliver's excommunication in 1838 (see pages 38-39).
