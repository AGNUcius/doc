Automated clothes washing:
Sort laundry by dropping clothes into various chutes (or maybe sliding a lever that would select the chute, allowing just one hole) instead of having a clothes hamper.  Hopefully each bedroom and kitchen would have a chute.

The chutes end at baskets which hold laundry until a weight of laundry triggers the system to:

. Replace that basket with an empty one.
. Move full basket to wash queue.
. When washer is empty, dump next from wash queue.
. Fill washer with programmable temperature water.
. Add programmable amount/type of detergents.
. Begin wash at programmable agitation strength, wash and soak times.
. Wait for solar clothes dryer to be empty.
. Dump clothes into solar clothes dryer.
. Dry at programmable heat, time.
. Dump dried clothes into clean baskets.
. Optional light-duty elevator carries clean baskets to programmable floor levels.

Baskets ride on wheels along rails - maybe similar to a roller-coaster, or to the way this is already done for so much of manufacturing in the world.

Solar assisted slow-tumble dryer.
